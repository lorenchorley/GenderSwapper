It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a <span class="transformed">husband</span>.<p></p><p></p>
However little known the feelings or views of such a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> may be on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their <span class="transformed">sons</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"My dear <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet replied that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had not.<p></p><p></p>
"But it is," returned <span class="transformed">he</span>; "for <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Long has just been here, and <span class="transformed">he</span> told me all about it."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet made no answer.<p></p><p></p>
"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span> impatiently.<p></p><p></p>
"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."<p></p><p></p>
This was invitation enough.<p></p><p></p>
"Why, my dear, you must know, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> of large fortune from the north of England; that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> agreed with <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Morris immediately; that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."<p></p><p></p>
"What is <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> name?"<p></p><p></p>
"Bingley."<p></p><p></p>
"Is <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> married or single?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our <span class="transformed">boys</span>!"<p></p><p></p>
"How so? How can it affect them?"<p></p><p></p>
"My dear <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>, "how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> marrying one of them."<p></p><p></p>
"Is that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> design in settling here?"<p></p><p></p>
"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> as soon as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> comes."<p></p><p></p>
"I see no occasion for that. You and the <span class="transformed">boys</span> may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> as any of them, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley may like you the best of the party."<p></p><p></p>
"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a <span class="transformed">man</span> has five grown-up <span class="transformed">sons</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> ought to give over thinking of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own beauty."<p></p><p></p>
"In such cases, a <span class="transformed">man</span> has not often much beauty to think of."<p></p><p></p>
"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> comes into the neighbourhood."<p></p><p></p>
"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."<p></p><p></p>
"But consider your <span class="transformed">sons</span>. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span> are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> if you do not."<p></p><p></p>
"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> of my hearty consent to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> marrying whichever <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> chooses of the <span class="transformed">boys</span>; though I must throw in a good word for my little <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"I desire you will do no such thing. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span> is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure <span class="transformed">he</span> is not half so <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, nor half so good-humoured as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>. But you are always giving <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> the preference."<p></p><p></p>
"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>; "they are all silly and ignorant like other <span class="transformed">boys</span>; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span> has something more of quickness than <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves."<p></p><p></p>
"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least."<p></p><p></p>
"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."<p></p><p></p>
"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span> of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."<p></p><p></p>
"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them."<p></p><p></p>
"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span> understand <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> character. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> mind was less difficult to develop. <span class="transformed">He</span> was a <span class="transformed">man</span> of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When <span class="transformed">he</span> was discontented, <span class="transformed">he</span> fancied <span class="transformed">himself</span> nervous. The business of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> life was to get <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">sons</span> married; its solace was visiting and news.<p></p><p></p>

<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had always intended to visit <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, though to the last always assuring <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span> that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid <span class="transformed">he</span> had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> second <span class="transformed">son</span> employed in trimming a hat, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> suddenly addressed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with:<p></p><p></p>
"I hope <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley will like it, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"We are not in a way to know what <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley likes," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> resentfully, "since we are not to visit."<p></p><p></p>
"But you forget, <span class="transformed">papa</span>," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "that we shall meet <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at the assemblies, and that <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Long promised to introduce <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"I do not believe <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Long will do any such thing. <span class="transformed">He</span> has two <span class="transformed">nephews</span> of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own. <span class="transformed">He</span> is a selfish, hypocritical <span class="transformed">man</span>, and I have no opinion of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"No more have I," said <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> serving you."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain <span class="transformed">himself</span>, began scolding one of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">sons</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"Don't keep coughing so, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, for Heaven's sake! Have a little compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> has no discretion in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> coughs," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>; "<span class="transformed">he</span> times them ill."<p></p><p></p>
"I do not cough for my own amusement," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> fretfully. "When is your next ball to be, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"To-morrow fortnight."<p></p><p></p>
"Aye, so it is," cried <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, "and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Long does not come back till the day before; so it will be impossible for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to introduce <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, for <span class="transformed">he</span> will not know <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">himself</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Impossible, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> myself; how can you be so teasing?"<p></p><p></p>
"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly very little. One cannot know what a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> really is by the end of a fortnight. But if we do not venture somebody else will; and after all, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Long and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">nephews</span> must stand their chance; and, therefore, as <span class="transformed">he</span> will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will take it on myself."<p></p><p></p>
The <span class="transformed">boys</span> stared at their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet said only, "Nonsense, nonsense!"<p></p><p></p>
"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>. "Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you there. What say you, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span>? For you are a young <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.<p></p><p></p>
"While <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> is adjusting <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ideas," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> continued, "let us return to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>.

"I am sick of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"I am sorry to hear that; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now."<p></p><p></p>
The astonishment of the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> was just what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> wished; that of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was over, <span class="transformed">he</span> began to declare that it was what <span class="transformed">he</span> had expected all the while.<p></p><p></p>
"How good it was in you, my dear <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your <span class="transformed">boys</span> too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now."<p></p><p></p>
"Now, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, you may cough as much as you choose," said <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet; and, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> spoke, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> left the room, fatigued with the raptures of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"What an excellent <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> you have, <span class="transformed">boys</span>!" said <span class="transformed">he</span>, when the door was shut. "I do not know how you will ever make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> amends for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do anything. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, my love, though you are the youngest, I dare say <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh!" said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I am the youngest, I'm the tallest."<p></p><p></p>
The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would return <span class="transformed">Ms</span>.

Bennet, however, with the assistance of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> five <span class="transformed">sons</span>, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> any satisfactory description of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley. They attacked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span>. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> report was highly favourable. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> had been delighted with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was quite young, wonderfully <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's heart were entertained.<p></p><p></p>
"If I can but see one of my <span class="transformed">sons</span> happily settled at Netherfield," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."<p></p><p></p>
In a few days <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley returned <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> library. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span>, of whose beauty <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had heard much; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> saw only the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>. The <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.<p></p><p></p>
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was quite disconcerted. <span class="transformed">He</span> could not imagine what business <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could have in town so soon after <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> arrival in Hertfordshire; and <span class="transformed">he</span> began to fear that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> ought to be. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span> quieted <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> fears a little by starting the idea of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley was to bring twelve <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> and seven <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to the assembly. The <span class="transformed">boys</span> grieved over such a number of <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span>, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> brought only six with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> from London—<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> five <span class="transformed">brothers</span> and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> two <span class="transformed">brothers</span>, the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> of the eldest, and another young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley was good-looking and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladylike</span></span>; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> were fine <span class="transformed">men</span>, with an air of decided fashion. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>-in-law, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Hurst, merely looked the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> fine, tall person, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> entrance, of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> having ten thousand a year. The <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> pronounced <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to be a fine figure of a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> declared <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was much handsomer than <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> popularity; for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was discovered to be proud; to be above <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> company, and above being pleased; and not all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> large estate in Derbyshire could then save <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley had soon made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> acquainted with all the principal people in the room; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend! <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy danced only once with <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst and once with <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley, declined being introduced to any other <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own party. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> character was decided. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was the proudest, most disagreeable <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> in the world, and everybody hoped that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would never come there again. Amongst the most violent against <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> was <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, whose dislike of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> having slighted one of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">sons</span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span>, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy had been standing near enough for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to hear a conversation between <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend to join it.<p></p><p></p>
"Come, Darcy," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance."<p></p><p></p>
"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable. Your <span class="transformed">brothers</span> are engaged, and there is not another <span class="transformed">man</span> in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with."<p></p><p></p>
"I would not be so fastidious as you are," cried <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, "for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant <span class="transformed">boys</span> in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty."<p></p><p></p>
"You are dancing with the only <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> <span class="transformed">boy</span> in the room," said <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, looking at the eldest <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! <span class="transformed">He</span> is the most <span class="transformed">handsome</span> creature I ever beheld! But there is one of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."<p></p><p></p>
"Which do you mean?" and turning round <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> looked for a moment at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, till catching <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eye, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> withdrew <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own and coldly said: "<span class="transformed">He</span> is tolerable, but not <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> enough to tempt me; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> who are slighted by other <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span>. You had better return to your partner and enjoy <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> smiles, for you are wasting your time with me."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley followed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> advice. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy walked off; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> remained with no very cordial feelings toward <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> told the story, however, with great spirit among <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friends; for <span class="transformed">he</span> had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.<p></p><p></p>
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet had seen <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eldest <span class="transformed">son</span> much admired by the Netherfield party. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley had danced with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> twice, and <span class="transformed">he</span> had been distinguished by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was as much gratified by this as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> could be, though in a quieter way. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> felt <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s pleasure. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> had heard <span class="transformed">himself</span> mentioned to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley as the most accomplished <span class="transformed">boy</span> in the neighbourhood; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet still up. With a book <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was regardless of time; and on the present occasion <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had rather hoped that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>'s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> soon found out that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had a different story to hear.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! my dear <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet," as <span class="transformed">he</span> entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well <span class="transformed">he</span> looked; and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley thought <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> quite <span class="transformed">handsome</span>, and danced with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> twice! Only think of that, my dear; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> actually danced with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> twice! and <span class="transformed">he</span> was the only creature in the room that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> asked a second time. First of all, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> asked <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas. I was so vexed to see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> stand up with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>! But, however, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did not admire <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> seemed quite struck with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> as <span class="transformed">he</span> was going down the dance. So <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> inquired who <span class="transformed">he</span> was, and got introduced, and asked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for the two next. Then the two third <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> danced with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Mr King</span></span>, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> again, and the two sixth with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, and the Boulanger—"<p></p><p></p>
"If <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had had any compassion for me," cried <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> impatiently, "<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would not have danced half so much! For <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Goddess</span></span>'s sake, say no more of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> partners. Oh that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had sprained <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> ankle in the first dance!"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is so excessively <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>! And <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> are charming <span class="transformed">men</span>. I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst's gown—"<p></p><p></p>
Here <span class="transformed">he</span> was interrupted again. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet protested against any description of finery. <span class="transformed">He</span> was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy.<p></p><p></p>
"But I can assure you," <span class="transformed">he</span> added, "that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span> does not lose much by not suiting <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> fancy; for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is a most disagreeable, horrid <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> walked here, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> walked there, fancying <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> so very great! Not <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> one of your set-downs. I quite detest the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.<p></p><p></p>
"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."<p></p><p></p>
In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.<p></p><p></p>
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from London—his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it.<p></p><p></p>
"Come, Darcy," said he, "I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance."<p></p><p></p>

"You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room," said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you."<p></p><p></p>
"Which do you mean?" and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said: "She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.

Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.<p></p><p></p>
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane's pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife's views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet," as she entered the room, "we have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.

"If he had had any compassion for me," cried her husband impatiently, "he would not have danced half so much! For God's sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst's gown—"<p></p><p></p>

When <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> were alone, the former, who had been cautious in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> praise of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley before, expressed to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> just how very much <span class="transformed">he</span> admired <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is just what a young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> ought to be," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is also <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "which a young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> ought likewise to be, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> possibly can. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> character is thereby complete."<p></p><p></p>
"I was very much flattered by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment."<p></p><p></p>
"Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never. What could be more natural than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> asking you again? <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other <span class="transformed">man</span> in the room. No thanks to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> gallantry for that. Well, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave to like <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. You have liked many a stupider person."<p></p><p></p>
"Dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>!"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your life."<p></p><p></p>
"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak what I think."<p></p><p></p>
"I know you do; and it is that which makes the wonder. With your good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough—one meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design—to take the good of everybody's character and make it still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone. And so you like this <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>'s <span class="transformed">brothers</span>, too, do you? Their manners are not equal to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Certainly not—at first. But they are very pleasing <span class="transformed">men</span> when you converse with them. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley is to live with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, and keep <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, and with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to <span class="transformed">himself</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> was very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span>; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited. They were rather <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>, had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>'s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> county; but as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> temper, whether <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might not spend the remainder of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> were anxious for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> having an estate of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own; but, though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was now only established as a tenant, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> table—nor was <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst, who had married a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> house as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> home when it suited <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley had not been of age two years, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour—was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.<p></p><p></p>
Between <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own, and though with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that respect <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense.<p></p><p></p>
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier <span class="transformed">boys</span> in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; there had been no formality, no stiffness; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could not conceive an angel more <span class="transformed">handsome</span>. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> acknowledged to be pretty, but <span class="transformed">he</span> smiled too much.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> allowed it to be so—but still they admired <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> and liked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and pronounced <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to be a sweet <span class="transformed">boy</span>, and one whom they would not object to know more of. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet was therefore established as a sweet <span class="transformed">boy</span>, and their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> felt authorized by such commendation to think of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> chose.<p></p><p></p>

When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him.<p></p><p></p>
"He is just what a young man ought to be," said she, "sensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"<p></p><p></p>
"He is also handsome," replied Elizabeth, "which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete."<p></p><p></p>

"Certainly not—at first. But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her."<p></p><p></p>

Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it.

Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so—but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose.<p></p><p></p>

Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">queen</span></span> during <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> a disgust to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> business, and to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> residence in a small market town; and, in quitting them both, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had removed with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> family to a house about a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could think with pleasure of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own importance, and, unshackled by business, occupy <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> solely in being civil to all the world. For, though elated by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> rank, it did not render <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> supercilious; on the contrary, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> presentation at St. James's had made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> courteous.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span> was a very good kind of <span class="transformed">man</span>, not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young <span class="transformed">man</span>, about twenty-seven, was <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s intimate friend.<p></p><p></p>
That the <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucases and the <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.<p></p><p></p>
"You began the evening well, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet with civil self-command to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas. "You were <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's first choice."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> seemed to like <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> second better."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! you mean <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, I suppose, because <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> danced with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> twice. To be sure that did seem as if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> admired <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>—indeed I rather believe <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did—I heard something about it—but I hardly know what—something about <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Robinson."<p></p><p></p>
"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Robinson; did not I mention it to you? <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Robinson's asking <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> how <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did not think there were a great many pretty <span class="transformed">men</span> in the room, and which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> thought the prettiest? and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> answering immediately to the last question: 'Oh! the eldest <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, beyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.'"<p></p><p></p>
"Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed—that does seem as if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know."<p></p><p></p>
"My overhearings were more to the purpose than yours, Eliza," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>. "<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend, is <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>?—poor Eliza!—to be only just tolerable."<p></p><p></p>
"I beg you would not put it into <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>'s head to be vexed by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> ill-treatment, for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is such a disagreeable <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Long told me last night that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> sat close to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for half-an-hour without once opening <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> lips."<p></p><p></p>
"Are you quite sure, ma'am?—is not there a little mistake?" said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>. "I certainly saw <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy speaking to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Aye—because <span class="transformed">he</span> asked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at last how <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> liked Netherfield, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could not help answering <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; but <span class="transformed">he</span> said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> seemed quite angry at being spoke to."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley told me," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, "that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> never speaks much, unless among <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> intimate acquaintances. With them <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is remarkably agreeable."<p></p><p></p>
"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been so very agreeable, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would have talked to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Long. But I can guess how it was; everybody says that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is eat up with pride, and I dare say <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had heard somehow that <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."<p></p><p></p>
"I do not mind <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> not talking to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Long," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas, "but I wish <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had danced with Eliza."<p></p><p></p>
"Another time, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, "I would not dance with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, if I were you."<p></p><p></p>
"I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you never to dance with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> pride," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas, "does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, with family, fortune, everything in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> favour, should think highly of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>. If I may so express it, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has a right to be proud."<p></p><p></p>
"That is very true," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "and I could easily forgive <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> pride, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had not mortified mine."<p></p><p></p>
"Pride," observed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span>, who piqued <span class="transformed">himself</span> upon the solidity of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> reflections, "is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."<p></p><p></p>
"If I were as rich as <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy," cried a young Lucas, who came with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span>, "I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day."<p></p><p></p>
"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly."<p></p><p></p>
The <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">girl</span></span> protested that <span class="transformed">he</span> should not; <span class="transformed">he</span> continued to declare that <span class="transformed">he</span> would, and the argument ended only with the visit.<p></p><p></p>

"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his ill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips."<p></p><p></p>
"Are you quite sure, ma'am?—is not there a little mistake?" said Jane. "I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her."<p></p><p></p>
"Aye—because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he could not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at being spoke to."<p></p><p></p>
"Miss Bingley told me," said Jane, "that he never speaks much, unless among his intimate acquaintances. With them he is remarkably agreeable."<p></p><p></p>
"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very agreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it was; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."<p></p><p></p>
"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long," said Miss Lucas, "but I wish he had danced with Eliza."<p></p><p></p>
"Another time, Lizzy," said her mother, "I would not dance with him, if I were you."<p></p><p></p>
"I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you never to dance with him."<p></p><p></p>
"His pride," said Miss Lucas, "does not offend me so much as pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour, should think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a right to be proud."<p></p><p></p>
"That is very true," replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine."<p></p><p></p>
"Pride," observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us."<p></p><p></p>
"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas, who came with his sisters, "I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day."<p></p><p></p>
"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought," said Mrs. Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle directly."<p></p><p></p>
The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit.<p></p><p></p>

The <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was soon returned in due form. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley; and though the <span class="transformed">father</span> was found to be intolerable, and the younger <span class="transformed">brothers</span> not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest. By <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, and could not like them; though their kindness to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>'s admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did admire <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> and to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> it was equally evident that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was yielding to the preference which <span class="transformed">he</span> had begun to entertain for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but <span class="transformed">he</span> considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> from the suspicions of the impertinent. <span class="transformed">He</span> mentioned this to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas.<p></p><p></p>
"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a <span class="transformed">man</span> conceals <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> affection with the same skill from the object of it, <span class="transformed">he</span> may lose the opportunity of fixing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely—a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a <span class="transformed">men</span> had better show more affection than <span class="transformed">he</span> feels. Bingley likes your <span class="transformed">brother</span> undoubtedly; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> may never do more than like <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, if <span class="transformed">he</span> does not help <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> on."<p></p><p></p>
"But <span class="transformed">he</span> does help <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> on, as much as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> nature will allow. If I can perceive <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> regard for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too."<p></p><p></p>
"Remember, Eliza, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> does not know <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s disposition as you do."<p></p><p></p>
"But if a <span class="transformed">man</span> is partial to a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, and does not endeavour to conceal it, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must find it out."<p></p><p></p>
"Perhaps <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> sees enough of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. But, though Bingley and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which <span class="transformed">he</span> can command <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attention. When <span class="transformed">he</span> is secure of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as <span class="transformed">he</span> chooses."<p></p><p></p>
"Your plan is a good one," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>, or any <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s feelings; <span class="transformed">he</span> is not acting by design. As yet, <span class="transformed">he</span> cannot even be certain of the degree of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own regard nor of its reasonableness. <span class="transformed">He</span> has known <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> only a fortnight. <span class="transformed">He</span> danced four dances with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at Meryton; <span class="transformed">he</span> saw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> one morning at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own house, and has since dined with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in company four times. This is not quite enough to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> understand <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> character."<p></p><p></p>
"Not as you represent it. Had <span class="transformed">he</span> merely dined with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> might only have discovered whether <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together—and four evenings may do a great deal."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."<p></p><p></p>
"Well," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>, "I wish <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> success with all my heart; and if <span class="transformed">he</span> were married to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to-morrow, I should think <span class="transformed">he</span> had as good a chance of happiness as if <span class="transformed">he</span> were to be studying <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life."<p></p><p></p>
"You make me laugh, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."<p></p><p></p>
Occupied in observing <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's attentions to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was far from suspecting that <span class="transformed">he</span> was <span class="transformed">himself</span> becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to be pretty; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had looked at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> looked at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> only to criticise. But no sooner had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> made it clear to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friends that <span class="transformed">he</span> hardly had a good feature in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> face, than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the <span class="transformed">handsome</span> expression of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> form, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was forced to acknowledge <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> asserting that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> manners were not those of the fashionable world, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this <span class="transformed">he</span> was perfectly unaware; to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was only the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> who made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> enough to dance with.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> began to wish to know more of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and as a step towards conversing with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, attended to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> conversation with others. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> doing so drew <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> notice. It was at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.<p></p><p></p>
"What does <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy mean," said <span class="transformed">he</span> to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>, "by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?"<p></p><p></p>
"That is a question which <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy only can answer."<p></p><p></p>
"But if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> does it any more I shall certainly let <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> know that I see what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is about. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
On <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas defied <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend to mention such a subject to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; which immediately provoking <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> to do it, <span class="transformed">he</span> turned to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> and said:<p></p><p></p>
"Did you not think, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?"<p></p><p></p>
"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> energetic."<p></p><p></p>
"You are severe on us."<p></p><p></p>
"It will be <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> turn soon to be teased," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas. "I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."<p></p><p></p>
"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers." On <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas's persevering, however, <span class="transformed">he</span> added, "Very well, if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing at <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with: 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and I shall keep mine to swell my song."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or two, and before <span class="transformed">he</span> could reply to the entreaties of several that <span class="transformed">he</span> would sing again, <span class="transformed">he</span> was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span>, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> application, it had given <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than <span class="transformed">he</span> had reached. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span>, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> younger <span class="transformed">brothers</span>, who, with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> thoughts to perceive that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> Lucas was <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> neighbour, till <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> thus began:<p></p><p></p>
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy! There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society."<p></p><p></p>
"Certainly, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> only smiled. "Your friend performs delightfully," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; "and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy."<p></p><p></p>
"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do you often dance at St. James's?"<p></p><p></p>
"Never, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"<p></p><p></p>
"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."<p></p><p></p>
"You have a house in town, I conclude?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy bowed.<p></p><p></p>
"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself—for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> paused in hopes of an answer; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> companion was not disposed to make any; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> at that instant moving towards them, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>:<p></p><p></p>
"My dear <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Eliza, why are you not dancing? <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> to you as a very desirable partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you." And, taking <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> hand, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would have given it to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when <span class="transformed">he</span> instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span>:<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> hand, but in vain. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was determined; nor did <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> at all shake <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> purpose by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attempt at persuasion.<p></p><p></p>
"You excel so much in the dance, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> dislikes the amusement in general, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half-hour."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy is all politeness," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, smiling.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Eliza, we cannot wonder at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> complaisance—for who would object to such a partner?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> looked archly, and turned away. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> resistance had not injured <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was thinking of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with some complacency, when thus accosted by <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley:<p></p><p></p>
"I can guess the subject of your reverie."<p></p><p></p>
"I should imagine not."<p></p><p></p>
"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise—the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!"<p></p><p></p>
"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty <span class="transformed">man</span> can bestow."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley immediately fixed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> face, and desired <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would tell <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> what <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> had the credit of inspiring such reflections. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> Bennet."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> Bennet!" repeated <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley. "I am all astonishment. How long has <span class="transformed">he</span> been such a favourite?—and pray, when am I to wish you joy?"<p></p><p></p>
"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>'s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy."<p></p><p></p>
"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled. You will be having a charming <span class="transformed">father</span>-in-law, indeed; and, of course, <span class="transformed">he</span> will always be at Pemberley with you."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> listened to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with perfect indifference while <span class="transformed">he</span> chose to entertain <span class="transformed">himself</span> in this manner; and as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> composure convinced <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that all was safe, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> wit flowed long.<p></p><p></p>

The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet's pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them; though their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brother's admiration. It was generally evident whenever they met, that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane united, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.<p></p><p></p>
"It may perhaps be pleasant," replied Charlotte, "to be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all begin freely—a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show more affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on."<p></p><p></p>
"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too."<p></p><p></p>
"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do."<p></p><p></p>
"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out."<p></p><p></p>
"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses."<p></p><p></p>
"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane's feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character."<p></p><p></p>
"Not as you represent it. Had she merely dined with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together—and four evenings may do a great deal."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."<p></p><p></p>
"Well," said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life."<p></p><p></p>
"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."<p></p><p></p>
Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley's attentions to her sister, Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly had a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with.<p></p><p></p>
He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas's, where a large party were assembled.<p></p><p></p>
"What does Mr. Darcy mean," said she to Charlotte, "by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?"<p></p><p></p>
"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer."<p></p><p></p>
"But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him."<p></p><p></p>
On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said:<p></p><p></p>
"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?"<p></p><p></p>
"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic."<p></p><p></p>
"You are severe on us."<p></p><p></p>
"It will be her turn soon to be teased," said Miss Lucas. "I am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."<p></p><p></p>
"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers." On Miss Lucas's persevering, however, she added, "Very well, if it must be so, it must." And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, "There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar with: 'Keep your breath to cool your porridge'; and I shall keep mine to swell my song."<p></p><p></p>
Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.<p></p><p></p>
Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:<p></p><p></p>
"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society."<p></p><p></p>
"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance."<p></p><p></p>
Sir William only smiled. "Your friend performs delightfully," he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; "and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy."<p></p><p></p>
"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do you often dance at St. James's?"<p></p><p></p>
"Never, sir."<p></p><p></p>
"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"<p></p><p></p>
"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it."<p></p><p></p>
"You have a house in town, I conclude?"<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Darcy bowed.<p></p><p></p>
"I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself—for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas."<p></p><p></p>
He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her:<p></p><p></p>
"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you." And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.<p></p><p></p>
"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us for one half-hour."<p></p><p></p>
"Mr. Darcy is all politeness," said Elizabeth, smiling.<p></p><p></p>
"He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we cannot wonder at his complaisance—for who would object to such a partner?"<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:<p></p><p></p>
"I can guess the subject of your reverie."<p></p><p></p>
"I should imagine not."<p></p><p></p>
"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise—the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!"<p></p><p></p>
"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow."<p></p><p></p>
Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:<p></p><p></p>
"Miss Elizabeth Bennet."<p></p><p></p>
"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!" repeated Miss Bingley. "I am all astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?—and pray, when am I to wish you joy?"<p></p><p></p>
"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy."<p></p><p></p>
"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you."<p></p><p></p>
He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">sons</span>, was entailed, in default of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">heiresses</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">female</span></span>, on a distant relation; and their <span class="transformed">father</span>'s fortune, though ample for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> four thousand pounds.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> had a <span class="transformed">brother</span> married to a <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> and succeeded <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in the business, and a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> settled in London in a respectable line of trade.<p></p><p></p>
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span>, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their <span class="transformed">uncle</span> and to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their <span class="transformed">brothers</span>', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their <span class="transformed">uncle</span>. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.<p></p><p></p>
Their visits to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Phillips visited them all, and this opened to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">nephews</span> a store of felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their <span class="transformed">father</span>, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.<p></p><p></p>
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet coolly observed:<p></p><p></p>
"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest <span class="transformed">boys</span> in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> was disconcerted, and made no answer; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, with perfect indifference, continued to express <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> admiration of Captain Carter, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> hope of seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in the course of the day, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was going the next morning to London.<p></p><p></p>
"I am astonished, my dear," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however."<p></p><p></p>
"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."<p></p><p></p>
"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest <span class="transformed">sons</span> uncommonly foolish."<p></p><p></p>
"My dear <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, you must not expect such <span class="transformed">boys</span> to have the sense of their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> and <span class="transformed">father</span>. When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my <span class="transformed">boys</span> I shall not say nay to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span>'s in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> regimentals."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Papa</span>," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, "my <span class="transformed">uncle</span> says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Watson's as they did when they first came; <span class="transformed">he</span> sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and <span class="transformed">he</span> was eagerly calling out, while <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span> read,<p></p><p></p>
"Well, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, who is it from? What is it about? What does <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> say? Well, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."<p></p><p></p>
"It is from <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, and then read it aloud.<p></p><p></p>
"MY DEAR FRIEND,—<p></p><p></p>
"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two <span class="transformed">men</span> can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> and the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> are to dine with the officers.—Yours ever,<p></p><p></p>
"CAROLINE BINGLEY"<p></p><p></p>
"With the officers!" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>. "I wonder my <span class="transformed">uncle</span> did not tell us of that."<p></p><p></p>
"Dining out," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, "that is very unlucky."<p></p><p></p>
"Can I have the carriage?" said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night."<p></p><p></p>
"That would be a good scheme," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> home."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! but the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> will have <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."<p></p><p></p>
"I had much rather go in the coach."<p></p><p></p>
"But, my dear, your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are wanted in the farm, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, are they not?"<p></p><p></p>
"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."<p></p><p></p>
"But if you have got them to-day," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "my <span class="transformed">father</span>'s purpose will be answered."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> did at last extort from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> attended <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> hopes were answered; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had not been gone long before it rained hard. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> were uneasy for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, but <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> was delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> certainly could not come back.<p></p><p></p>
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own. Till the next morning, however, <span class="transformed">he</span> was not aware of all the felicity of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>:<p></p><p></p>
"MY DEAREST LIZZY,—<p></p><p></p>
"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> having been to me—and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter with me.—Yours, etc."<p></p><p></p>
"Well, my dear," said <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had read the note aloud, "if your <span class="transformed">son</span> should have a dangerous fit of illness—if <span class="transformed">he</span> should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, and under your orders."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! I am not afraid of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> dying. People do not die of little trifling colds. <span class="transformed">He</span> will be taken good care of. As long as <span class="transformed">he</span> stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> if I could have the carriage."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, though the carriage was not to be had; and as <span class="transformed">he</span> was no horsewoman, walking was <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> only alternative. <span class="transformed">He</span> declared <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> resolution.<p></p><p></p>
"How can you be so silly," cried <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there."<p></p><p></p>
"I shall be very fit to see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>—which is all I want."<p></p><p></p>
"Is this a hint to me, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, "to send for the horses?"<p></p><p></p>
"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner."<p></p><p></p>
"I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span>, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."<p></p><p></p>
"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> accepted their company, and the three young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> set off together.<p></p><p></p>
"If we make haste," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> goes."<p></p><p></p>
In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' <span class="transformed">husbands</span>, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> continued <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding <span class="transformed">himself</span> at last within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> were assembled, and where <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> appearance created a great deal of surprise. That <span class="transformed">he</span> should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by <span class="transformed">himself</span>, was almost incredible to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was convinced that they held <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in contempt for it. <span class="transformed">He</span> was received, however, very politely by them; and in their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>'s manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy said very little, and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> coming so far alone. The latter was thinking only of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> breakfast.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> inquiries after <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> were not very favourably answered. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> room. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was glad to be taken to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> immediately; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> note how much <span class="transformed">he</span> longed for such a visit, was delighted at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> entrance. <span class="transformed">He</span> was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness <span class="transformed">he</span> was treated with. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> silently attended <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
When breakfast was over they were joined by the <span class="transformed">brothers</span>; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> began to like them <span class="transformed">himself</span>, when <span class="transformed">he</span> saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>. The apothecary came, and having examined <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> patient, said, as might be supposed, that <span class="transformed">he</span> had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to return to bed, and promised <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> head ached acutely. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> did not quit <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> room for a moment; nor were the other <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> often absent; the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere.<p></p><p></p>
When the clock struck three, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> felt that <span class="transformed">he</span> must go, and very unwillingly said so. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley offered <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> the carriage, and <span class="transformed">he</span> only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> testified such concern in parting with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, that <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> stay and bring back a supply of clothes.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Bennet's property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother's fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds.<p></p><p></p>
She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.<p></p><p></p>
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner's shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters', and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters.<p></p><p></p>
Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers' names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley's large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign.<p></p><p></p>
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed:<p></p><p></p>
"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced."<p></p><p></p>
Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.<p></p><p></p>
"I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "that you should be so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly of anybody's children, it should not be of my own, however."<p></p><p></p>
"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."<p></p><p></p>
"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish."<p></p><p></p>
"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William's in his regimentals."<p></p><p></p>
"Mamma," cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson's as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke's library."<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,<p></p><p></p>
"Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."<p></p><p></p>
"It is from Miss Bingley," said Jane, and then read it aloud.<p></p><p></p>
"MY DEAR FRIEND,—<p></p><p></p>
"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day's tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.—Yours ever,<p></p><p></p>
"CAROLINE BINGLEY"<p></p><p></p>
"With the officers!" cried Lydia. "I wonder my aunt did not tell us of that."<p></p><p></p>
"Dining out," said Mrs. Bennet, "that is very unlucky."<p></p><p></p>
"Can I have the carriage?" said Jane.<p></p><p></p>
"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night."<p></p><p></p>
"That would be a good scheme," said Elizabeth, "if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley's chaise to go to Meryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."<p></p><p></p>
"I had much rather go in the coach."<p></p><p></p>
"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?"<p></p><p></p>
"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."<p></p><p></p>
"But if you have got them to-day," said Elizabeth, "my mother's purpose will be answered."<p></p><p></p>
She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not come back.<p></p><p></p>
"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!" said Mrs. Bennet more than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth:<p></p><p></p>
"MY DEAREST LIZZY,—<p></p><p></p>
"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me—and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the matter with me.—Yours, etc."<p></p><p></p>
"Well, my dear," said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness—if she should die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though the carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking was her only alternative. She declared her resolution.<p></p><p></p>
"How can you be so silly," cried her mother, "as to think of such a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get there."<p></p><p></p>
"I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want."<p></p><p></p>
"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy," said her father, "to send for the horses?"<p></p><p></p>
"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner."<p></p><p></p>
"I admire the activity of your benevolence," observed Mary, "but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is required."<p></p><p></p>
"We will go as far as Meryton with you," said Catherine and Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off together.<p></p><p></p>
"If we make haste," said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes."<p></p><p></p>
In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers' wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise.<p></p><p></p>
She was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise. That she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their brother's manners there was something better than politeness; there was good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as to the occasion's justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was thinking only of his breakfast.<p></p><p></p>
Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her.<p></p><p></p>
When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere.<p></p><p></p>
When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
At five o'clock the two <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> retired to dress, and at half-past six <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which <span class="transformed">he</span> had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not make a very favourable answer. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was by no means better. The <span class="transformed">brothers</span>, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> when not immediately before them restored <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> to the enjoyment of all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> former dislike.<p></p><p></p>
Their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, indeed, was the only one of the party whom <span class="transformed">he</span> could regard with any complacency. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> anxiety for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was evident, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attentions to <span class="transformed">himself</span> most pleasing, and they prevented <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feeling <span class="transformed">himself</span> so much an intruder as <span class="transformed">he</span> believed <span class="transformed">he</span> was considered by the others. <span class="transformed">He</span> had very little notice from any but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley was engrossed by <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> scarcely less so; and as for <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Hurst, by whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> sat, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was an indolent <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> found <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
When dinner was over, <span class="transformed">he</span> returned directly to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley began abusing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> as soon as <span class="transformed">he</span> was out of the room. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; <span class="transformed">he</span> had no conversation, no style, no beauty. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst thought the same, and added:<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">He</span> has nothing, in short, to recommend <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, but being an excellent walker. I shall never forget <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> appearance this morning. <span class="transformed">He</span> really looked almost wild."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">He</span> did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must <span class="transformed">he</span> be scampering about the country, because <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> had a cold? <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> hair, so untidy, so blowsy!"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> petticoat; I hope you saw <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office."<p></p><p></p>
"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was all lost upon me. I thought <span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> Bennet looked remarkably well when <span class="transformed">he</span> came into the room this morning. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice."<p></p><p></p>
"You observed it, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, I am sure," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley; "and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your <span class="transformed">brother</span> make such an exhibition."<p></p><p></p>
"Certainly not."<p></p><p></p>
"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could <span class="transformed">he</span> mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum."<p></p><p></p>
"It shows an affection for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> that is very pleasing," said Bingley.<p></p><p></p>
"I am afraid, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy," observed <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> fine eyes."<p></p><p></p>
"Not at all," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> replied; "they were brightened by the exercise." A short pause followed this speech, and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst began again:<p></p><p></p>
"I have an excessive regard for <span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> Bennet, <span class="transformed">he</span> is really a very sweet <span class="transformed">boy</span>, and I wish with all my heart <span class="transformed">he</span> were well settled. But with such a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> and <span class="transformed">father</span>, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it."<p></p><p></p>
"I think I have heard you say that their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> is an attorney in Meryton."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."<p></p><p></p>
"That is capital," added <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, and they both laughed heartily.<p></p><p></p>
"If they had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunts</span></span> enough to fill all Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable."<p></p><p></p>
"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span> of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy.<p></p><p></p>
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.<p></p><p></p>
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> till summoned to coffee. <span class="transformed">He</span> was still very poorly, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> would not quit <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> at all, till late in the evening, when <span class="transformed">he</span> had the comfort of seeing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> sleep, and when it seemed to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> rather right than pleasant that <span class="transformed">he</span> should go downstairs <span class="transformed">himself</span>. On entering the drawing-room <span class="transformed">he</span> found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high <span class="transformed">he</span> declined it, and making <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> the excuse, said <span class="transformed">he</span> would amuse <span class="transformed">himself</span> for the short time <span class="transformed">he</span> could stay below, with a book. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Hurst looked at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with astonishment.<p></p><p></p>
"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>; "that is rather singular."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Eliza Bennet," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley, "despises cards. <span class="transformed">He</span> is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else."<p></p><p></p>
"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; "I am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."<p></p><p></p>
"In nursing your <span class="transformed">brother</span> I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> quite well."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> thanked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> heart, and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> immediately offered to fetch <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> others—all that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> library afforded.<p></p><p></p>
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever looked into."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> assured <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> that <span class="transformed">he</span> could suit <span class="transformed">himself</span> perfectly with those in the room.<p></p><p></p>
"I am astonished," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley, "that my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> should have left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy!"<p></p><p></p>
"It ought to be good," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> replied, "it has been the work of many generations."<p></p><p></p>
"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books."<p></p><p></p>
"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these."<p></p><p></p>
"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley."<p></p><p></p>
"I wish it may."<p></p><p></p>
"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire."<p></p><p></p>
"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it."<p></p><p></p>
"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."<p></p><p></p>
"Upon my word, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Carl</span></span>, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was so much caught with what passed, as to leave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> very little attention for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> book; and soon laying it wholly aside, <span class="transformed">he</span> drew near the card-table, and stationed <span class="transformed">himself</span> between <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> eldest <span class="transformed">brother</span>, to observe the game.<p></p><p></p>
"Is <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy much grown since the spring?" said <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley; "will <span class="transformed">he</span> be as tall as I am?"<p></p><p></p>
"I think <span class="transformed">he</span> will. <span class="transformed">He</span> is now about <span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> Bennet's height, or rather taller."<p></p><p></p>
"How I long to see <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> age! <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> performance on the pianoforte is exquisite."<p></p><p></p>
"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are."<p></p><p></p>
"All young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> spoken of for the first time, without being informed that <span class="transformed">he</span> was very accomplished."<p></p><p></p>
"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has too much truth. The word is applied to many a <span class="transformed">man</span> who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished."<p></p><p></p>
"Nor I, I am sure," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley.<p></p><p></p>
"Then," observed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished <span class="transformed">man</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! certainly," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A <span class="transformed">man</span> must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, <span class="transformed">he</span> must possess a certain something in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> air and manner of walking, the tone of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> voice, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved."<p></p><p></p>
"All this <span class="transformed">he</span> must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this <span class="transformed">he</span> must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> mind by extensive reading."<p></p><p></p>
"I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished <span class="transformed">men</span>. I rather wonder now at your knowing any."<p></p><p></p>
"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?"<p></p><p></p>
"I never saw such a <span class="transformed">man</span>. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley both cried out against the injustice of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many <span class="transformed">men</span> who answered this description, when <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> soon afterwards left the room.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> Bennet," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley, when the door was closed on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, "is one of those young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span>, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."<p></p><p></p>
"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is a meanness in all the arts which <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> joined them again only to say that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> was worse, and that <span class="transformed">he</span> could not leave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. Bingley urged <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Jones being sent for immediately; while <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span>, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. This <span class="transformed">he</span> would not hear of; but <span class="transformed">he</span> was not so unwilling to comply with their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>'s proposal; and it was settled that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could find no better relief to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> feelings than by giving <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
At five o'clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley's, she could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.<p></p><p></p>
Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.<p></p><p></p>
When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence; she had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:<p></p><p></p>
"She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really looked almost wild."<p></p><p></p>
"She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must she be scampering about the country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office."<p></p><p></p>
"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa," said Bingley; "but this was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice."<p></p><p></p>
"You observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure," said Miss Bingley; "and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition."<p></p><p></p>
"Certainly not."<p></p><p></p>
"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is, above her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum."<p></p><p></p>
"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing," said Bingley.<p></p><p></p>
"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy," observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, "that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes."<p></p><p></p>
"Not at all," he replied; "they were brightened by the exercise." A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:<p></p><p></p>
"I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it."<p></p><p></p>
"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."<p></p><p></p>
"That is capital," added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.<p></p><p></p>
"If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside," cried Bingley, "it would not make them one jot less agreeable."<p></p><p></p>
"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world," replied Darcy.<p></p><p></p>
To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend's vulgar relations.<p></p><p></p>
With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the excuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.<p></p><p></p>
"Do you prefer reading to cards?" said he; "that is rather singular."<p></p><p></p>
"Miss Eliza Bennet," said Miss Bingley, "despises cards. She is a great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else."<p></p><p></p>
"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure," cried Elizabeth; "I am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things."<p></p><p></p>
"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure," said Bingley; "and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the table where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her others—all that his library afforded.<p></p><p></p>
"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more than I ever looked into."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room.<p></p><p></p>
"I am astonished," said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!"<p></p><p></p>
"It ought to be good," he replied, "it has been the work of many generations."<p></p><p></p>
"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying books."<p></p><p></p>
"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these."<p></p><p></p>
"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build your house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley."<p></p><p></p>
"I wish it may."<p></p><p></p>
"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire."<p></p><p></p>
"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it."<p></p><p></p>
"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."<p></p><p></p>
"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very little attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest sister, to observe the game.<p></p><p></p>
"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley; "will she be as tall as I am?"<p></p><p></p>
"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or rather taller."<p></p><p></p>
"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite."<p></p><p></p>
"It is amazing to me," said Bingley, "how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are."<p></p><p></p>
"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being informed that she was very accomplished."<p></p><p></p>
"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments," said Darcy, "has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that are really accomplished."<p></p><p></p>
"Nor I, I am sure," said Miss Bingley.<p></p><p></p>
"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! certainly," cried his faithful assistant, "no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides all this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word will be but half-deserved."<p></p><p></p>
"All this she must possess," added Darcy, "and to all this she must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading."<p></p><p></p>
"I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any."<p></p><p></p>
"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?"<p></p><p></p>
"I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united."<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.<p></p><p></p>
"Elizabeth Bennet," said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art."<p></p><p></p>
"Undoubtedly," replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, "there is a meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable."<p></p><p></p>
Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> passed the chief of the night in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which <span class="transformed">he</span> very early received from <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> who waited on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span>. In spite of this amendment, however, <span class="transformed">he</span> requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> to visit <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, and form <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own judgement of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, accompanied by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> two youngest <span class="transformed">boys</span>, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.<p></p><p></p>
Had <span class="transformed">he</span> found <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> in any apparent danger, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> illness was not alarming, <span class="transformed">he</span> had no wish of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> recovering immediately, as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> restoration to health would probably remove <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> from Netherfield. <span class="transformed">He</span> would not listen, therefore, to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>'s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, on <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley's appearance and invitation, the <span class="transformed">father</span> and three <span class="transformed">sons</span> all attended <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet had not found <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet worse than <span class="transformed">he</span> expected.<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed I have, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>," was <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> answer. "<span class="transformed">He</span> is a great deal too ill to be moved. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Jones says we must not think of moving <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness."<p></p><p></p>
"Removed!" cried Bingley. "It must not be thought of. My <span class="transformed">brother</span>, I am sure, will not hear of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> removal."<p></p><p></p>
"You may depend upon it, <span class="transformed">Sir</span>," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley, with cold civility, "that <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet will receive every possible attention while <span class="transformed">he</span> remains with us."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was profuse in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> acknowledgments.<p></p><p></p>
"I am sure," <span class="transformed">he</span> added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, for <span class="transformed">he</span> is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, for <span class="transformed">he</span> has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other <span class="transformed">boys</span> they are nothing to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. You have a sweet room here, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease."<p></p><p></p>
"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>; "and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."<p></p><p></p>
"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, turning towards <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! yes—I understand you perfectly."<p></p><p></p>
"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful."<p></p><p></p>
"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>," cried <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."<p></p><p></p>
"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have at least that advantage."<p></p><p></p>
"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society."<p></p><p></p>
"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, indeed," cried <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, offended by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. "I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town."<p></p><p></p>
Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for a moment, turned silently away. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, who fancied <span class="transformed">he</span> had gained a complete victory over <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, continued <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> triumph.<p></p><p></p>
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley?"<p></p><p></p>
"When I am in the country," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> replied, "I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."<p></p><p></p>
"Aye—that is because you have the right disposition. But that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all."<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed, <span class="transformed">Papa</span>, you are mistaken," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, blushing for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>. "You quite mistook <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true."<p></p><p></p>
"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families."<p></p><p></p>
Nothing but concern for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could enable Bingley to keep <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> countenance. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> was less delicate, and directed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes towards <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy with a very expressive smile. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, for the sake of saying something that might turn <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>'s thoughts, now asked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> Lucas had been at Longbourn since <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> coming away.<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, <span class="transformed">he</span> called yesterday with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>. What an agreeable <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> is, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, is not <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>? So much the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> of fashion! So genteel and easy! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> has always something to say to everybody. That is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter."<p></p><p></p>
"Did <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> dine with you?"<p></p><p></p>
"No, <span class="transformed">he</span> would go home. I fancy <span class="transformed">he</span> was wanted about the mince-pies. For my part, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work; my <span class="transformed">sons</span> are brought up very differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of <span class="transformed">boys</span>, I assure you. It is a pity they are not <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>! Not that I think <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> so very plain—but then <span class="transformed">he</span> is our particular friend."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">He</span> seems a very pleasant young <span class="transformed">man</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own <span class="transformed">he</span> is very plain. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span> <span class="transformed">himself</span> has often said so, and envied me <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>—one does not often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When <span class="transformed">he</span> was only fifteen, there was a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> at my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> Gardiner's in town so much in love with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that my <span class="transformed">brother</span>-in-law was sure <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> an offer before we came away. But, however, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did not. Perhaps <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> thought <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> too young. However, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> wrote some verses on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and very pretty they were."<p></p><p></p>
"And so ended <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> affection," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> impatiently. "There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"<p></p><p></p>
"I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love," said Darcy.<p></p><p></p>
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."<p></p><p></p>
Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> tremble lest <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> should be exposing <span class="transformed">himself</span> again. <span class="transformed">He</span> longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet began repeating <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> thanks to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> kindness to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, with an apology for troubling <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> also with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> answer, and forced <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> younger <span class="transformed">brother</span> to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. <span class="transformed">He</span> performed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> part indeed without much graciousness, but <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">sons</span> put <span class="transformed">himself</span> forward. The two <span class="transformed">boys</span> had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley with having promised on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> was a stout, well-grown <span class="transformed">boy</span> of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, whose affection had brought <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> into public at an early age. <span class="transformed">He</span> had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>'s good dinners, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own easy manners recommended <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, had increased into assurance. <span class="transformed">He</span> was very equal, therefore, to address <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did not keep it. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their <span class="transformed">father</span>'s ear:<p></p><p></p>
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your <span class="transformed">brother</span> is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when <span class="transformed">he</span> is ill."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> declared <span class="transformed">himself</span> satisfied. "Oh! yes—it would be much better to wait till <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given your ball," <span class="transformed">he</span> added, "I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> does not."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">sons</span> then departed, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> returned instantly to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, leaving <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, in spite of all <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley's witticisms on fine eyes.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister's room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.<p></p><p></p>
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter's proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley's appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed I have, sir," was her answer. "She is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness."<p></p><p></p>
"Removed!" cried Bingley. "It must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal."<p></p><p></p>
"You may depend upon it, Madam," said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, "that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us."<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.<p></p><p></p>
"I am sure," she added, "if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to her. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease."<p></p><p></p>
"Whatever I do is done in a hurry," replied he; "and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here."<p></p><p></p>
"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you," said Elizabeth.<p></p><p></p>
"You begin to comprehend me, do you?" cried he, turning towards her.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! yes—I understand you perfectly."<p></p><p></p>
"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful."<p></p><p></p>
"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."<p></p><p></p>
"Lizzy," cried her mother, "remember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."<p></p><p></p>
"I did not know before," continued Bingley immediately, "that you were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, but intricate characters are the most amusing. They have at least that advantage."<p></p><p></p>
"The country," said Darcy, "can in general supply but a few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society."<p></p><p></p>
"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, indeed," cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood. "I assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town."<p></p><p></p>
Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him, continued her triumph.<p></p><p></p>
"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?"<p></p><p></p>
"When I am in the country," he replied, "I never wish to leave it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."<p></p><p></p>
"Aye—that is because you have the right disposition. But that gentleman," looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was nothing at all."<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken," said Elizabeth, blushing for her mother. "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true."<p></p><p></p>
"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families."<p></p><p></p>
Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother's thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since her coming away.<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. That is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter."<p></p><p></p>
"Did Charlotte dine with you?"<p></p><p></p>
"No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work; my daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think Charlotte so very plain—but then she is our particular friend."<p></p><p></p>
"She seems a very pleasant young woman."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane's beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane—one does not often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner's in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were."<p></p><p></p>
"And so ended his affection," said Elizabeth impatiently. "There has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!"<p></p><p></p>
"I have been used to consider poetry as the food of love," said Darcy.<p></p><p></p>
"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away."<p></p><p></p>
Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.<p></p><p></p>
Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother's ear:<p></p><p></p>
"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill."<p></p><p></p>
Lydia declared herself satisfied. "Oh! yes—it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given your ball," she added, "I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not."<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on fine eyes.<p></p><p></p>

The day passed much as the day before had done. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> joined their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy was writing, and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley, seated near <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, was watching the progress of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> letter and repeatedly calling off <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attention by messages to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Hurst and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley were at piquet, and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst was observing their game.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> companion. The perpetual commendations of the <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>, either on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> handwriting, or on the evenness of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> lines, or on the length of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> letter, with the perfect unconcern with which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in union with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> opinion of each.<p></p><p></p>
"How delighted <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> made no answer.<p></p><p></p>
"You write uncommonly fast."<p></p><p></p>
"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly."<p></p><p></p>
"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!"<p></p><p></p>
"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours."<p></p><p></p>
"Pray tell your <span class="transformed">brother</span> that I long to see <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"I have already told <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> so once, by your desire."<p></p><p></p>
"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well."<p></p><p></p>
"Thank you—but I always mend my own."<p></p><p></p>
"How can you contrive to write so even?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was silent.<p></p><p></p>
"Tell your <span class="transformed">brother</span> I am delighted to hear of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> improvement on the harp; and pray let <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> know that I am quite in raptures with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">handsome</span> little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Grantley's."<p></p><p></p>
"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At present I have not room to do them justice."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy?"<p></p><p></p>
"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine."<p></p><p></p>
"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill."<p></p><p></p>
"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Carl</span></span>," cried <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, "because <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> does not write with ease. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?"<p></p><p></p>
"My style of writing is very different from yours."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh!" cried <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> leaves out half <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> words, and blots the rest."<p></p><p></p>
"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them—by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."<p></p><p></p>
"Your humility, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "must disarm reproof."<p></p><p></p>
"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."<p></p><p></p>
"And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?"<p></p><p></p>
"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself—and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?"<p></p><p></p>
"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go—and at another word, might stay a month."<p></p><p></p>
"You have only proved by this," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley did not do justice to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own disposition. You have shown <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> off now much more than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> did by no means intend; for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would certainly think better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could."<p></p><p></p>
"Would <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"<p></p><p></p>
"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> return to the house, and the delay of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety."<p></p><p></p>
"To yield readily—easily—to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you."<p></p><p></p>
"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either."<p></p><p></p>
"You appear to me, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"<p></p><p></p>
"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?"<p></p><p></p>
"By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> half so much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has nothing to do."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy smiled; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> thought <span class="transformed">he</span> could perceive that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was rather offended, and therefore checked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> laugh. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley warmly resented the indignity <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had received, in an expostulation with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> for talking such nonsense.<p></p><p></p>
"I see your design, Bingley," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend. "You dislike an argument, and want to silence this."<p></p><p></p>
"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."<p></p><p></p>
"What you ask," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "is no sacrifice on my side; and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy had much better finish <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> letter."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy took <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> advice, and did finish <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> letter.<p></p><p></p>
When that business was over, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> applied to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> for an indulgence of some music. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, <span class="transformed">he</span> seated <span class="transformed">himself</span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst sang with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, and while they were thus employed, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could not help observing, as <span class="transformed">he</span> turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's eyes were fixed on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> hardly knew how to suppose that <span class="transformed">he</span> could be an object of admiration to so great a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>; and yet that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should look at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> because <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> disliked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, was still more strange. <span class="transformed">He</span> could only imagine, however, at last that <span class="transformed">he</span> drew <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible, according to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not pain <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> liked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> too little to care for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> approbation.<p></p><p></p>
After playing some Italian songs, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, drawing near <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, said to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>:<p></p><p></p>
"Do not you feel a great inclination, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> smiled, but made no answer. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> repeated the question, with some surprise at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> silence.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh!" said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all—and now despise me if you dare."<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed I do not dare."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, having rather expected to affront <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, was amazed at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> manner which made it difficult for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any <span class="transformed">man</span> as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> connections, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should be in some danger.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> great anxiety for the recovery of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> dear friend <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> received some assistance from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> desire of getting rid of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> happiness in such an alliance.<p></p><p></p>
"I hope," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your <span class="transformed">father</span>-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger <span class="transformed">boys</span> of running after officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> possesses."<p></p><p></p>
"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span> Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> the judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines. As for your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those <span class="transformed">handsome</span> eyes?"<p></p><p></p>
"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied."<p></p><p></p>
At that moment they were met from another walk by <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> <span class="transformed">himself</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.<p></p><p></p>
"You used us abominably ill," answered <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst, "running away without telling us that you were coming out."<p></p><p></p>
Then taking the disengaged arm of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, <span class="transformed">he</span> left <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> to walk by <span class="transformed">himself</span>. The path just admitted three. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said:<p></p><p></p>
"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the avenue."<p></p><p></p>
But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, who had not the least inclination to remain with them, laughingly answered:<p></p><p></p>
"No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> then ran gaily off, rejoicing as <span class="transformed">he</span> rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was already so much recovered as to intend leaving <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> room for a couple of hours that evening.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual commendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in union with her opinion of each.<p></p><p></p>
"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"<p></p><p></p>
He made no answer.<p></p><p></p>
"You write uncommonly fast."<p></p><p></p>
"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly."<p></p><p></p>
"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!"<p></p><p></p>
"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours."<p></p><p></p>
"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her."<p></p><p></p>
"I have already told her so once, by your desire."<p></p><p></p>
"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well."<p></p><p></p>
"Thank you—but I always mend my own."<p></p><p></p>
"How can you contrive to write so even?"<p></p><p></p>
He was silent.<p></p><p></p>
"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley's."<p></p><p></p>
"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At present I have not room to do them justice."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?"<p></p><p></p>
"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine."<p></p><p></p>
"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill."<p></p><p></p>
"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline," cried her brother, "because he does not write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?"<p></p><p></p>
"My style of writing is very different from yours."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest."<p></p><p></p>
"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them—by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents."<p></p><p></p>
"Your humility, Mr. Bingley," said Elizabeth, "must disarm reproof."<p></p><p></p>
"Nothing is more deceitful," said Darcy, "than the appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an indirect boast."<p></p><p></p>
"And which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty?"<p></p><p></p>
"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of compliment to yourself—and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?"<p></p><p></p>
"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies."<p></p><p></p>
"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay till next week,' you would probably do it, you would probably not go—and at another word, might stay a month."<p></p><p></p>
"You have only proved by this," cried Elizabeth, "that Mr. Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much more than he did himself."<p></p><p></p>
"I am exceedingly gratified," said Bingley, "by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I could."<p></p><p></p>
"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"<p></p><p></p>
"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for himself."<p></p><p></p>
"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety."<p></p><p></p>
"To yield readily—easily—to the persuasion of a friend is no merit with you."<p></p><p></p>
"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either."<p></p><p></p>
"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"<p></p><p></p>
"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties?"<p></p><p></p>
"By all means," cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars, not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he has nothing to do."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense.<p></p><p></p>
"I see your design, Bingley," said his friend. "You dislike an argument, and want to silence this."<p></p><p></p>
"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."<p></p><p></p>
"What you ask," said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.<p></p><p></p>
When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy's eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation.<p></p><p></p>
After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her:<p></p><p></p>
"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?"<p></p><p></p>
She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some surprise at her silence.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh!" said she, "I heard you before, but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all—and now despise me if you dare."<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed I do not dare."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he should be in some danger.<p></p><p></p>
Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.<p></p><p></p>
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.<p></p><p></p>
"I hope," said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after officers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady possesses."<p></p><p></p>
"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth's picture, you must not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?"<p></p><p></p>
"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be copied."<p></p><p></p>
At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and Elizabeth herself.<p></p><p></p>
"I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in some confusion, lest they had been overheard.<p></p><p></p>
"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "running away without telling us that you were coming out."<p></p><p></p>
Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness, and immediately said:<p></p><p></p>
"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the avenue."<p></p><p></p>

She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
When the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> removed after dinner, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> ran up to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, and seeing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> well guarded from cold, attended <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> into the drawing-room, where <span class="transformed">he</span> was welcomed by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> two friends with many professions of pleasure; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.<p></p><p></p>
But when the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> entered, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was no longer the first object; <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and <span class="transformed">he</span> had something to say to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had advanced many steps. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> addressed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, with a polite congratulation; <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Hurst also made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> a slight bow, and said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was full of joy and attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest <span class="transformed">he</span> should suffer from the change of room; and <span class="transformed">he</span> removed at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> desire to the other side of the fireplace, that <span class="transformed">he</span> might be further from the door. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> then sat down by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and talked scarcely to anyone else. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.<p></p><p></p>
When tea was over, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Hurst reminded <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>-in-law of the card-table—but in vain. <span class="transformed">He</span> had obtained private intelligence that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy did not wish for cards; and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Hurst soon found even <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> open petition rejected. <span class="transformed">He</span> assured <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> on one of the sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley did the same; and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> bracelets and rings, joined now and then in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>'s conversation with <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's progress through <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> book, as in reading <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own; and <span class="transformed">he</span> was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> page. <span class="transformed">He</span> could not win <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, however, to any conversation; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> merely answered <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own book, which <span class="transformed">he</span> had only chosen because it was the second volume of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library."<p></p><p></p>
No one made any reply. <span class="transformed">He</span> then yawned again, threw aside <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> book, and cast <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> mentioning a ball to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, <span class="transformed">he</span> turned suddenly towards <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> and said:<p></p><p></p>
"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure."<p></p><p></p>
"If you mean Darcy," cried <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, "<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> may go to bed, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> chooses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards."<p></p><p></p>
"I should like balls infinitely better," <span class="transformed">he</span> replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day."<p></p><p></p>
"Much more rational, my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Carl</span></span>, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards <span class="transformed">he</span> got up and walked about the room. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> figure was elegant, and <span class="transformed">he</span> walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feelings, <span class="transformed">he</span> resolved on one effort more, and, turning to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, said:<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> civility; <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy looked up. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> <span class="transformed">himself</span> could be, and unconsciously closed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> book. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was directly invited to join their party, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> declined it, observing that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> joining them would interfere. "What could <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> mean? <span class="transformed">He</span> was dying to know what could be <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> meaning?"—and asked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> whether <span class="transformed">he</span> could at all understand <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>?<p></p><p></p>
"Not at all," was <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> answer; "but depend upon it, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> will be to ask nothing about it."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> two motives.<p></p><p></p>
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, as soon as <span class="transformed">he</span> allowed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to speak. "You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! shocking!" cried <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley. "I never heard anything so abominable. How shall we punish <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> for such a speech?"<p></p><p></p>
"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>. "We can all plague and punish one another. Tease <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>—laugh at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."<p></p><p></p>
"But upon my honour, I do not. I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that. Tease calmness of manner and presence of mind! No, no; I feel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy may hug <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>. "That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a laugh."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "has given me more credit than can be. The wisest and the best of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span>—nay, the wisest and best of their actions—may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke."<p></p><p></p>
"Certainly," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>—"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without."<p></p><p></p>
"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule."<p></p><p></p>
"Such as vanity and pride."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> turned away to hide a smile.<p></p><p></p>
"Your examination of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy is over, I presume," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley; "and pray what is the result?"<p></p><p></p>
"I am perfectly convinced by it that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy has no defect. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> owns it <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> without disguise."<p></p><p></p>
"No," said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yielding—certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever."<p></p><p></p>
"That is a failing indeed!" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>. "Implacable resentment is a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I really cannot laugh at it. You are safe from me."<p></p><p></p>
"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil—a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome."<p></p><p></p>
"And your defect is to hate everybody."<p></p><p></p>
"And yours," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> replied with a smile, "is willfully to misunderstand them."<p></p><p></p>
"Do let us have a little music," cried <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley, tired of a conversation in which <span class="transformed">he</span> had no share. "Louisa, you will not mind my waking <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Hurst?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened; and Darcy, after a few moments' recollection, was not sorry for it. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> began to feel the danger of paying <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> too much attention.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit.<p></p><p></p>
But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley's eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great delight.<p></p><p></p>
When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the card-table—but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings, joined now and then in her brother's conversation with Miss Bennet.<p></p><p></p>
Miss Bingley's attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr. Darcy's progress through his book, as in reading her own; and she was perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her question, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library."<p></p><p></p>
No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said:<p></p><p></p>
"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure."<p></p><p></p>
"If you mean Darcy," cried her brother, "he may go to bed, if he chooses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards."<p></p><p></p>
"I should like balls infinitely better," she replied, "if they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day."<p></p><p></p>
"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball."<p></p><p></p>
Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:<p></p><p></p>
"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked up. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was directly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with either of which motives his joining them would interfere. "What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his meaning?"—and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?<p></p><p></p>
"Not at all," was her answer; "but depend upon it, he means to be severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it."<p></p><p></p>
Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives.<p></p><p></p>
"I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he, as soon as she allowed him to speak. "You either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other's confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! shocking!" cried Miss Bingley. "I never heard anything so abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?"<p></p><p></p>
"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination," said Elizabeth. "We can all plague and punish one another. Tease him—laugh at him. Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done."<p></p><p></p>
"But upon my honour, I do not. I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that. Tease calmness of manner and presence of mind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself."<p></p><p></p>
"Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth. "That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a laugh."<p></p><p></p>
"Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me more credit than can be. The wisest and the best of men—nay, the wisest and best of their actions—may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke."<p></p><p></p>
"Certainly," replied Elizabeth—"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of them. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, do divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what you are without."<p></p><p></p>
"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule."<p></p><p></p>
"Such as vanity and pride."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.<p></p><p></p>
"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss Bingley; "and pray what is the result?"<p></p><p></p>
"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it himself without disguise."<p></p><p></p>
"No," said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little yielding—certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself.

In consequence of an agreement between the <span class="transformed">brothers</span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> wrote the next morning to their <span class="transformed">father</span>, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. But <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, who had calculated on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">sons</span> remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s week, could not bring <span class="transformed">himself</span> to receive them with pleasure before. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s wishes, for <span class="transformed">he</span> was impatient to get home. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> postscript it was added, that if <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> pressed them to stay longer, <span class="transformed">he</span> could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was positively resolved—nor did <span class="transformed">he</span> much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, <span class="transformed">he</span> urged <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> to borrow <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.<p></p><p></p>
The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>; and till the morrow their going was deferred. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley was then sorry that <span class="transformed">he</span> had proposed the delay, for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> jealousy and dislike of one <span class="transformed">brother</span> much exceeded <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> affection for the other.<p></p><p></p>
The <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span> of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet that it would not be safe for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>—that <span class="transformed">he</span> was not enough recovered; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was firm where <span class="transformed">he</span> felt <span class="transformed">himself</span> to be right.<p></p><p></p>
To <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy it was welcome intelligence—<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had been at Netherfield long enough. <span class="transformed">He</span> attracted <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> more than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> liked—and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley was uncivil to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and more teasing than usual to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, nothing that could elevate <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with the hope of influencing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it. Steady to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> purpose, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> scarcely spoke ten words to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> through the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> adhered most conscientiously to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> book, and would not even look at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost all, took place. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley's civility to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> increased at last very rapidly, as well as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> affection for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to see <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> most tenderly, <span class="transformed">he</span> even shook hands with the former. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits.<p></p><p></p>
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their <span class="transformed">father</span>. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble, and was sure <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> would have caught cold again. But their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, though very laconic in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> expressions of pleasure, was really glad to see them; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had felt their importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
They found <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span>, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> had information for them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.<p></p><p></p>

In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well.

To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence—Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked—and Miss Bingley was uncivil to her, and more teasing than usual to himself. He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.

"I hope, my dear," said <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>, as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."<p></p><p></p>
"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure, unless <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> Lucas should happen to call in—and I hope my dinners are good enough for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. I do not believe <span class="transformed">he</span> often sees such at home."<p></p><p></p>
"The person of whom I speak is a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>, and a stranger."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet's eyes sparkled. "A <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> and a stranger! It is <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley. But—good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, my love, ring the bell—I must speak to Hill this moment."<p></p><p></p>
"It is not <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>; "it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life."<p></p><p></p>
This roused a general astonishment; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> five <span class="transformed">sons</span> at once.<p></p><p></p>
After amusing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> some time with their curiosity, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> thus explained:<p></p><p></p>
"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> pleases."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! my dear," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> tried to explain to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> the nature of an entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and <span class="transformed">he</span> continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five <span class="transformed">sons</span>, in favour of a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> whom nobody cared anything about.<p></p><p></p>
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, "and nothing can clear <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. But if you will listen to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> manner of expressing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why could <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> not keep on quarreling with you, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> did before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"Why, indeed; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear."<p></p><p></p>
"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.<p></p><p></p>
"Dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Madam</span></span>,—<p></p><p></p>
"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to be at variance.—'There, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet.'—My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> de Bourgh, <span class="transformed">widower</span> of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Madam</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliza</span></span> de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable <span class="transformed">sons</span>, and beg leave to apologise for it, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends—but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four o'clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se'ennight following, which I can do without any inconvenience, as <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.—I remain, dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>, with respectful compliments to your <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> and <span class="transformed">sons</span>, your well-wisher and friend,<p></p><p></p>
"WILLIAM COLLINS"<p></p><p></p>
"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>," said <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> folded up the letter. "<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> seems to be a most conscientious and polite young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, upon my word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> should be so indulgent as to let <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> come to us again."<p></p><p></p>
"There is some sense in what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> says about the <span class="transformed">boys</span>, however, and if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Though it is difficult," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, "to guess in what way <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> can mean to make us the atonement <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> thinks our due, the wish is certainly to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> credit."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was chiefly struck by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> extraordinary deference for <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> parishioners whenever it were required.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> must be an oddity, I think," said <span class="transformed">he</span>. "I cannot make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> out.—There is something very pompous in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> style.—And what can <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> mean by apologising for being next in the entail?—We cannot suppose <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would help it if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could.—Could <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> be a sensible <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"In point of composition," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span>, "the letter does not seem defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed."<p></p><p></p>
To <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> in any other colour. As for their <span class="transformed">father</span>, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's letter had done away much of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ill-will, and <span class="transformed">he</span> was preparing to see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> with a degree of composure which astonished <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> and <span class="transformed">sons</span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins was punctual to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet indeed said little; but the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> were ready enough to talk, and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was a tall, heavy-looking young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> of five-and-twenty. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> air was grave and stately, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> manners were very formal. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had not been long seated before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> complimented <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet on having so fine a family of <span class="transformed">sons</span>; said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did not doubt <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> hearers; but <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.<p></p><p></p>
"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly."<p></p><p></p>
"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate."<p></p><p></p>
"Ah! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor <span class="transformed">boys</span>, you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with you, for such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed."<p></p><p></p>
"I am very sensible, <span class="transformed">sir</span>, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted—"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the <span class="transformed">boys</span> smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> commendation of everything would have touched <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet's heart, but for the mortifying supposition of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> viewing it all as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> begged to know to which of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing. But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was set right there by <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, who assured <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook, and that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">sons</span> had nothing to do in the kitchen. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> begged pardon for having displeased <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. In a softened tone <span class="transformed">he</span> declared <span class="transformed">himself</span> not at all offended; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
"I hope, my dear," said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party."<p></p><p></p>
"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in—and I hope my dinners are good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home."<p></p><p></p>
"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger."<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Bennet's eyes sparkled. "A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. But—good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell—I must speak to Hill this moment."<p></p><p></p>
"It is not Mr. Bingley," said her husband; "it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life."<p></p><p></p>
This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.<p></p><p></p>
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:<p></p><p></p>
"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! my dear," cried his wife, "I cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it."<p></p><p></p>
Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.<p></p><p></p>
"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair," said Mr. Bennet, "and nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn. But if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself."<p></p><p></p>
"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false friends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did before him?"<p></p><p></p>
"Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head, as you will hear."<p></p><p></p>
"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.<p></p><p></p>
"Dear Sir,—<p></p><p></p>
"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the misfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.—'There, Mrs. Bennet.'—My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch.

"WILLIAM COLLINS"<p></p><p></p>
"At four o'clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman," said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. "He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again."<p></p><p></p>
"There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if he is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to discourage him."<p></p><p></p>
"Though it is difficult," said Jane, "to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his credit."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine, and his kind intention of christening, marrying, and burying his parishioners whenever it were required.<p></p><p></p>
"He must be an oddity, I think," said she. "I cannot make him out.—There is something very pompous in his style.—And what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entail?—We cannot suppose he would help it if he could.—Could he be a sensible man, sir?"<p></p><p></p>
"No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and self-importance in his letter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him."<p></p><p></p>
"In point of composition," said Mary, "the letter does not seem defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I think it is well expressed."<p></p><p></p>
To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collins's letter had done away much of her ill-will, and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great politeness by the whole family.

During dinner, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> thought it time to have some conversation with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> guest, and therefore started a subject in which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> expected <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to shine, by observing that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> seemed very fortunate in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> patroness. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> de Bourgh's attention to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> wishes, and consideration for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> comfort, appeared very remarkable. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet could not have chosen better. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins was eloquent in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> praise. The subject elevated <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> protested that "<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had never in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank—such affability and condescension, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> experienced from <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had already had the honour of preaching before <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> had also asked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> only the Saturday before, to make up <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> pool of quadrille in the evening. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> was reckoned proud by many people <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> knew, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had never seen anything but affability in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> had always spoken to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> as <span class="transformed">he</span> would to any other <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>; <span class="transformed">he</span> made not the smallest objection to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> relations. <span class="transformed">He</span> had even condescended to advise <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to marry as soon as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could, provided <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> chose with discretion; and had once paid <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> a visit in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> humble parsonage, where <span class="transformed">he</span> had perfectly approved all the alterations <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some <span class="transformed">himself</span>—some shelves in the closet up stairs."<p></p><p></p>
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, "and I dare say <span class="transformed">he</span> is a very agreeable <span class="transformed">man</span>. It is a pity that great <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> in general are not more like <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. Does <span class="transformed">he</span> live near you, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship's residence."<p></p><p></p>
"I think you said <span class="transformed">he</span> was a <span class="transformed">widower</span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>? Has <span class="transformed">he</span> any family?"<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">He</span> has only one <span class="transformed">son</span>, the <span class="transformed">heir</span> of Rosings, and of very extensive property."<p></p><p></p>
"Ah!" said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, shaking <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> head, "then <span class="transformed">he</span> is better off than many <span class="transformed">boys</span>. And what sort of young <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> is <span class="transformed">he</span>? Is <span class="transformed">he</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">He</span> is a most charming young <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> indeed. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> <span class="transformed">himself</span> says that, in point of true beauty, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> sex, because there is that in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> features which marks the young <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> of distinguished birth. <span class="transformed">He</span> is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> from making that progress in many accomplishments which <span class="transformed">he</span> could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> who superintended <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> education, and who still resides with them. But <span class="transformed">he</span> is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> little phaeton and ponies."<p></p><p></p>
"Has <span class="transformed">he</span> been presented? I do not remember <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> name among the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> at court."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> indifferent state of health unhappily prevents <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> being in town; and by that means, as I told <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span>. I have more than once observed to <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> charming <span class="transformed">son</span> seemed born to be a <span class="transformed">duke</span>, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> consequence, would be adorned by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. These are the kind of little things which please <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay."<p></p><p></p>
"You judge very properly," said <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?"<p></p><p></p>
"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> cousin was as absurd as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had hoped, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> listened to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, requiring no partner in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> pleasure.<p></p><p></p>
By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet was glad to take <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over, glad to invite <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to read aloud to the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span>. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a circulating library), <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> started back, and begging pardon, protested that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> never read novels. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> stared at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> chose Fordyce's Sermons. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> gaped as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> opened the volume, and before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, <span class="transformed">he</span> interrupted <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> with:<p></p><p></p>
"Do you know, <span class="transformed">papa</span>, that my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> Phillips talks of turning away Richard; and if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> does, Colonel Forster will hire <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. My <span class="transformed">uncle</span> told me so <span class="transformed">himself</span> on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Denny comes back from town."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> was bid by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> two eldest <span class="transformed">brothers</span> to hold <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> tongue; but <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, much offended, laid aside <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> book, and said:<p></p><p></p>
"I have often observed how little young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin."<p></p><p></p>
Then turning to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> offered <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> antagonist at backgammon. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> acted very wisely in leaving the <span class="transformed">boys</span> to their own trifling amusements. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">sons</span> apologised most civilly for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would resume <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> book; but <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, after assuring them that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> bore <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> behaviour as any affront, seated <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> at another table with <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants were withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he protested that "he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank—such affability and condescension, as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but he had never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself—some shelves in the closet up stairs."<p></p><p></p>
"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure," said Mrs. Bennet, "and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?"<p></p><p></p>
"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship's residence."<p></p><p></p>
"I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?"<p></p><p></p>
"She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property."<p></p><p></p>
"Ah!" said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, "then she is better off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?"<p></p><p></p>
"She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still resides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies."<p></p><p></p>
"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at court."<p></p><p></p>
"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by her. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay."<p></p><p></p>
"You judge very properly," said Mr. Bennet, "and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment, or are the result of previous study?"<p></p><p></p>
"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his pleasure.<p></p><p></p>
By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over, glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and begging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at him, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some deliberation he chose Fordyce's Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with:<p></p><p></p>
"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away Richard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town."<p></p><p></p>
Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:<p></p><p></p>
"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin."<p></p><p></p>
Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia's interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins was not a sensible <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>; and though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> belonged to one of the universities, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> had brought <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> up had given <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> felt for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> high rank, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> veneration for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> authority as a clergyman, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> right as a rector, made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.<p></p><p></p>
Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had a <span class="transformed">husband</span> in view, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> meant to choose one of the <span class="transformed">sons</span>, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> found them as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> and amiable as they were represented by common report. This was <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> plan of amends—of atonement—for inheriting their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s estate; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own part.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> plan did not vary on seeing them. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet's lovely face confirmed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> views, and established all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening <span class="transformed">he</span> was <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> settled choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> hopes, that a <span class="transformed">master</span> might be found for it at Longbourn, produced from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had fixed on. "As to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> younger <span class="transformed">sons</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not take upon <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to say—<span class="transformed">he</span> could not positively answer—but <span class="transformed">he</span> did not know of any prepossession; <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eldest <span class="transformed">son</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> must just mention—<span class="transformed">he</span> felt it incumbent on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins had only to change from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>—and it was soon done—done while <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was stirring the fire. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, equally next to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> in birth and beauty, succeeded <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> of course.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that <span class="transformed">he</span> might soon have two <span class="transformed">sons</span> married; and the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> whom <span class="transformed">he</span> could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> good graces.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every <span class="transformed">brother</span> except <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> agreed to go with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins was to attend them, at the request of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and have <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> library to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>; for thither <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins had followed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> after breakfast; and there <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, with little cessation, of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet exceedingly. In <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> library <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> told <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was used to be free from them there; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins to join <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">sons</span> in their walk; and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> large book, and go.<p></p><p></p>
In pompous nothings on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> side, and civil assents on that of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them.<p></p><p></p>
But the attention of every <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> was soon caught by a young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, whom they had never seen before, of most <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladylike</span></span> appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Denny concerning whose return from London <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> came to inquire, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could be; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span>, turning back, had reached the same spot. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham, who had returned with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> the day before from town, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> wanted only regimentals to make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> completely charming. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> appearance was greatly in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> favour; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> of the group, the two <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet the principal object. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was then, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> said, on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> eyes on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham, after a few moments, touched <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> hat—a salutation which <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.<p></p><p></p>
In another minute, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Denny and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham walked with the young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> to the door of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of <span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips was always glad to see <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">nephews</span>; and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and <span class="transformed">he</span> was eagerly expressing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, <span class="transformed">he</span> should have known nothing about, if <span class="transformed">he</span> had not happened to see <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Jones's shop-<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">girl</span></span> in the street, who had told <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennets were come away, when <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> civility was claimed towards <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s introduction of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> received <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> very best politeness, which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> returned with as much more, apologising for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could not help flattering <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, however, might be justified by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> relationship to the young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> who introduced <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> notice. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom, however, <span class="transformed">he</span> could only tell <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">nephews</span> what they already knew, that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Denny had brought <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> from London, and that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ——shire. <span class="transformed">He</span> had been watching <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> the last hour, <span class="transformed">he</span> said, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> walked up and down the street, and had <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham appeared, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their <span class="transformed">uncle</span> promised to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> call on <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham, and give <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins repeated <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.<p></p><p></p>
As they walked home, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> related to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> what <span class="transformed">he</span> had seen pass between the two <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span>; but though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, <span class="transformed">he</span> could no more explain such behaviour than <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> return highly gratified <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet by admiring <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips's manners and politeness. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> protested that, except <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had never seen a more elegant <span class="transformed">man</span>; for <span class="transformed">he</span> had not only received <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> before. Something, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> supposed, might be attributed to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> connection with them, but yet <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had never met with so much attention in the whole course of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> life.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.<p></p><p></p>
Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report. This was his plan of amends—of atonement—for inheriting their father's estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part.<p></p><p></p>
His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet's lovely face confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority; and for the first evening she was his settled choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. "As to her younger daughters, she could not take upon her to say—she could not positively answer—but she did not know of any prepossession; her eldest daughter, she must just mention—she felt it incumbent on her to hint, was likely to be very soon engaged."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth—and it was soon done—done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces.<p></p><p></p>
Lydia's intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.<p></p><p></p>
In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall them.<p></p><p></p>
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger's air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat—a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.<p></p><p></p>
In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Phillip's house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia's pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips's throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones's shop-boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane's introduction of him. She received him with her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom, however, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's commission in the ——shire. She had been watching him the last hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become "stupid, disagreeable fellows." Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.<p></p><p></p>
As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips's manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, and all <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's scruples of leaving <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet for a single evening during <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the <span class="transformed">boys</span> had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham had accepted their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>'s invitation, and was then in the house.<p></p><p></p>
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins was at leisure to look around <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> and admire, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> declared <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might almost have supposed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips understood from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> what Rosings was, and who was its <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">proprietress</span></span>—when <span class="transformed">he</span> had listened to the description of only one of <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>'s drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, <span class="transformed">he</span> felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.<p></p><p></p>
In describing to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> all the grandeur of <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was happily employed until the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> joined them; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> found in <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> consequence increased with what <span class="transformed">he</span> heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> neighbours as soon as <span class="transformed">he</span> could. To the <span class="transformed">boys</span>, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however. The <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> did approach, and when <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham walked into the room, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> felt that <span class="transformed">he</span> had neither been seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> before, nor thinking of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the ——shire were in general a very creditable, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladylike</span></span> set, and the best of them were of the present party; but <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham was the happy <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> towards whom almost every <span class="transformed">male</span> eye was turned, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was the happy <span class="transformed">man</span> by whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> finally seated <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>; and the agreeable manner in which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.<p></p><p></p>
With such rivals for the notice of the fair as <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham and the officers, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> certainly was nothing; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had still at intervals a kind listener in <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips, and was by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had the opportunity of obliging <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in turn, by sitting down to whist.<p></p><p></p>
"I know little of the game at present," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life—" <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips was very glad for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> compliance, but could not wait for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> reason.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> received at the other table between <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>. At first there seemed danger of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s engrossing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> entirely, for <span class="transformed">he</span> was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, <span class="transformed">he</span> soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, and <span class="transformed">he</span> was very willing to hear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, though what <span class="transformed">he</span> chiefly wished to hear <span class="transformed">he</span> could not hope to be told—the history of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> acquaintance with <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy. <span class="transformed">He</span> dared not even mention that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham began the subject <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy had been staying there.<p></p><p></p>
"About a month," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes," replied <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham; "<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> estate there is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for I have been connected with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> family in a particular manner from my infancy."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could not but look surprised.<p></p><p></p>
"You may well be surprised, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy?"<p></p><p></p>
"As much as I ever wish to be," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> very warmly. "I have spent four days in the same house with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and I think <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> very disagreeable."<p></p><p></p>
"I have no right to give my opinion," said Wickham, "as to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for me to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> would in general astonish—and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your own family."<p></p><p></p>
"Upon my word, I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> pride. You will not find <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> more favourably spoken of by anyone."<p></p><p></p>
"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short interruption, "that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> or that any <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> fortune and consequence, or frightened by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> high and imposing manners, and sees <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> only as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> chooses to be seen."<p></p><p></p>
"I should take <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>." Wickham only shook <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> head.<p></p><p></p>
"I wonder," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is likely to be in this country much longer."<p></p><p></p>
"I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> going away when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ——shire will not be affected by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> being in the neighbourhood."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! no—it is not for me to be driven away by <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy. If <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> wishes to avoid seeing me, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must go. We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, but I have no reason for avoiding <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> being what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, the late <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, was one of the best <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span> that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> anything and everything, rather than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.<p></p><p></p>
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ——shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me further by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, and my spirits will not bear solitude. I must have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church ought to have been my profession—I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> we were speaking of just now."<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed!"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes—the late <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> gift. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> kindness. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> meant to provide for me amply, and thought <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere."<p></p><p></p>
"Good heavens!" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; "but how could that be? How could <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?"<p></p><p></p>
"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. A <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> of honour could not have doubted the intention, but <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence—in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have spoken my opinion of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, too freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span>, and that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> hates me."<p></p><p></p>
"This is quite shocking! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> deserves to be publicly disgraced."<p></p><p></p>
"Some time or other <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will be—but it shall not be by me. Till I can forget <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, I can never defy or expose <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> honoured <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> for such feelings, and thought <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> handsomer than ever as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> expressed them.<p></p><p></p>
"But what," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, after a pause, "can have been <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> motive? What can have induced <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to behave so cruelly?"<p></p><p></p>
"A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy liked me less, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span> might have borne with me better; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s uncommon attachment to me irritated <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, I believe, very early in life. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood—the sort of preference which was often given me."<p></p><p></p>
"I had not thought <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never liked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. I had not thought so very ill of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. I had supposed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to be despising <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this."<p></p><p></p>
After a few minutes' reflection, however, <span class="transformed">he</span> continued, "I do remember <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> resentments, of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> having an unforgiving temper. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> disposition must be dreadful."<p></p><p></p>
"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham; "I can hardly be just to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>!" <span class="transformed">He</span> could have added, "A young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"—but <span class="transformed">he</span> contented <span class="transformed">himself</span> with, "and one, too, who had probably been <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"<p></p><p></p>
"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. My <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> began life in the profession which your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to—but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> gave up everything to be of use to the late <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy and devoted all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> time to the care of the Pemberley property. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was most highly esteemed by <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy often acknowledged <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> to be under the greatest obligations to my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s active superintendence, and when, immediately before my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s death, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy gave <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, as of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> affection to myself."<p></p><p></p>
"How strange!" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>. "How abominable! I wonder that the very pride of this <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy has not made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> just to you! If from no better motive, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should not have been too proud to be dishonest—for dishonesty I must call it."<p></p><p></p>
"It is wonderful," replied Wickham, "for almost all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> actions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> best friend. It has connected <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride."<p></p><p></p>
"Can such abominable pride as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> have ever done <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> good?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes. It has often led <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to be liberal and generous, to give <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> money freely, to display hospitality, to assist <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and filial pride—for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is very proud of what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> was—have done this. Not to appear to disgrace <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> has also brotherly pride, which, with some brotherly affection, makes <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> a very kind and careful guardian of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, and you will hear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> generally cried up as the most attentive and best of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sisters</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"What sort of <span class="transformed">boy</span> is <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> shook <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> head. "I wish I could call <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> amiable. It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But <span class="transformed">he</span> is too much like <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>—very, very proud. As a child, <span class="transformed">he</span> was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> amusement. But <span class="transformed">he</span> is nothing to me now. <span class="transformed">He</span> is a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> <span class="transformed">boy</span>, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s death, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> home has been London, where a <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> lives with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and superintends <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> education."<p></p><p></p>
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:<p></p><p></p>
"I am astonished at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> intimacy with <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley! How can <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>? How can they suit each other? Do you know <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley?"<p></p><p></p>
"Not at all."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> cannot know what <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy is."<p></p><p></p>
"Probably not; but <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy can please where <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> chooses. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> does not want abilities. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> can be a conversible companion if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> thinks it worth <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> while. Among those who are at all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> equals in consequence, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is a very different <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> from what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is to the less prosperous. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> pride never deserts <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; but with the rich <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable—allowing something for fortune and figure."<p></p><p></p>
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins took <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> station between <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousin <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> success were made by the latter. It had not been very great; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had lost every point; but when <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips began to express <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> concern thereupon, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> assured <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that <span class="transformed">he</span> would not make <span class="transformed">himself</span> uneasy.<p></p><p></p>
"I know very well, <span class="transformed">sir</span>," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "that when persons sit down to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins for a few moments, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> asked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> in a low voice whether <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> de Bourgh," <span class="transformed">he</span> replied, "has very lately given <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> a living. I hardly know how <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins was first introduced to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> notice, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> certainly has not known <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> long."<p></p><p></p>
"You know of course that <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> de Bourgh and <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Aubrey</span></span> Darcy were <span class="transformed">brothers</span>; consequently that <span class="transformed">he</span> is <span class="transformed">uncle</span> to the present <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy."<p></p><p></p>
"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>'s connections. I never heard of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> existence till the day before yesterday."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that <span class="transformed">he</span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> cousin will unite the two estates."<p></p><p></p>
This information made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> smile, as <span class="transformed">he</span> thought of poor <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley. Vain indeed must be all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> attentions, vain and useless <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> affection for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> praise of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> were already self-destined for another.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "speaks highly both of <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>; but from some particulars that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has related of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship, I suspect <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> gratitude misleads <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and that in spite of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> being <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> patroness, <span class="transformed">he</span> is an arrogant, conceited <span class="transformed">man</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"I believe <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have not seen <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> manners were dictatorial and insolent. <span class="transformed">He</span> has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe <span class="transformed">he</span> derives part of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> abilities from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> rank and fortune, part from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span>, who chooses that everyone connected with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> should have an understanding of the first class."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> allowed that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> their share of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips's supper party, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> manners recommended <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to everybody. Whatever <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> said, was said well; and whatever <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did, done gracefully. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> went away with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> head full of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> could think of nothing but of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham, and of what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had told <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, all the way home; but there was not time for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> even to mention <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> name as they went, for neither <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> nor <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins were once silent. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish <span class="transformed">he</span> had lost and the fish <span class="transformed">he</span> had won; and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins in describing the civility of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips, protesting that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did not in the least regard <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> crowded <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousins, had more to say than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p></article><article class="right"><p></p><h1>Chapter 16</h1><p></p><p></p>
<p></p><p></p>
As no objection was made to the young people's engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins's scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle's invitation, and was then in the house.<p></p><p></p>
When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor—when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine's drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper's room.<p></p><p></p>
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the ——shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as they were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.<p></p><p></p>
With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.<p></p><p></p>
"I know little of the game at present," said he, "but I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life—" Mrs. Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told—the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.<p></p><p></p>
"About a month," said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, "He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes," replied Mr. Wickham; "his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth could not but look surprised.<p></p><p></p>
"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?"<p></p><p></p>
"As much as I ever wish to be," cried Elizabeth very warmly. "I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable."<p></p><p></p>
"I have no right to give my opinion," said Wickham, "as to his being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for me to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish—and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your own family."<p></p><p></p>
"Upon my word, I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone."<p></p><p></p>
"I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen."<p></p><p></p>
"I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head.<p></p><p></p>
"I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer."<p></p><p></p>
"I do not at all know; but I heard nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ——shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! no—it is not for me to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he must go. We are not on friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for avoiding him but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry.<p></p><p></p>
"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society," he added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ——shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. I must have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church ought to have been my profession—I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now."<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed!"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes—the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me. I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere."<p></p><p></p>
"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could that be? How could his will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?"<p></p><p></p>
"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance, imprudence—in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and I may have spoken my opinion of him, and to him, too freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me."<p></p><p></p>
"This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced."<p></p><p></p>
"Some time or other he will be—but it shall not be by me. Till I can forget his father, I can never defy or expose him."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them.<p></p><p></p>
"But what," said she, after a pause, "can have been his motive? What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"<p></p><p></p>
"A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood—the sort of preference which was often given me."<p></p><p></p>
"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this."<p></p><p></p>
After a few minutes' reflection, however, she continued, "I do remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be dreadful."<p></p><p></p>
"I will not trust myself on the subject," replied Wickham; "I can hardly be just to him."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, "To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!" She could have added, "A young man, too, like you, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable"—but she contented herself with, "and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"<p></p><p></p>
"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. My father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to—but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence, and when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him, as of his affection to myself."<p></p><p></p>
"How strange!" cried Elizabeth. "How abominable! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest—for dishonesty I must call it."<p></p><p></p>
"It is wonderful," replied Wickham, "for almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride."<p></p><p></p>
"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the poor. Family pride, and filial pride—for he is very proud of what his father was—have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also brotherly pride, which, with some brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers."<p></p><p></p>
"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?"<p></p><p></p>
He shook his head. "I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother—very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education."<p></p><p></p>
After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:<p></p><p></p>
"I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?"<p></p><p></p>
"Not at all."<p></p><p></p>
"He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is."<p></p><p></p>
"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable—allowing something for fortune and figure."<p></p><p></p>
The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make herself uneasy.<p></p><p></p>
"I know very well, madam," said he, "that when persons sit down to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.<p></p><p></p>
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she replied, "has very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long."<p></p><p></p>
"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy."<p></p><p></p>
"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday."<p></p><p></p>
"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."<p></p><p></p>
This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined for another.<p></p><p></p>
"Mr. Collins," said she, "speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."<p></p><p></p>
"I believe her to be both in a great degree," replied Wickham; "I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips's supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> related to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> the next day what had passed between <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham and <span class="transformed">himself</span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> listened with astonishment and concern; <span class="transformed">he</span> knew not how to believe that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy could be so unworthy of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> nature to question the veracity of a young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The possibility of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> having endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.<p></p><p></p>
"They have both," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "been deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side."<p></p><p></p>
"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? Do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody."<p></p><p></p>
"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, to be treating <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s favourite in such a manner, one whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> of common humanity, no <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> who had any value for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> character, could be capable of it. Can <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>? Oh! no."<p></p><p></p>
"I can much more easily believe <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's being imposed on, than that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham should invent such a history of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> looks."<p></p><p></p>
"It is difficult indeed—it is distressing. One does not know what to think."<p></p><p></p>
"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think."<p></p><p></p>
But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> could think with certainty on only one point—that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.<p></p><p></p>
The two young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> came to give their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what <span class="transformed">he</span> had been doing with <span class="transformed">himself</span> since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet's civilities.<p></p><p></p>
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every <span class="transformed">male</span> of the family. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eldest <span class="transformed">son</span>, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, instead of a ceremonious card. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> pictured to <span class="transformed">himself</span> a happy evening in the society of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> two friends, and the attentions of their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's look and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, meant to dance half the evening with <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> could assure <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family that <span class="transformed">he</span> had no disinclination for it.<p></p><p></p>
"While I can have my mornings to myself," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "it is enough—I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though <span class="transformed">he</span> did not often speak unnecessarily to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not help asking <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> whether <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> intended to accept <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's invitation, and if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did, whether <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and <span class="transformed">he</span> was rather surprised to find that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.<p></p><p></p>
"I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "that a ball of this kind, given by a young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, for the two first dances especially, a preference which I trust my cousin <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> felt <span class="transformed">himself</span> completely taken in. <span class="transformed">He</span> had fully proposed being engaged by <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham for those very dances; and to have <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins instead! <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help for it, however. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham's happiness and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own were perforce delayed a little longer, and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's proposal accepted with as good a grace as <span class="transformed">he</span> could. <span class="transformed">He</span> was not the better pleased with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first struck <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, that <span class="transformed">he</span> was selected from among <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> as worthy of being <span class="transformed">master</span> of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as <span class="transformed">he</span> observed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> increasing civilities toward <span class="transformed">himself</span>, and heard <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> frequent attempt at a compliment on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified <span class="transformed">himself</span> by this effect of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> charms, it was not long before <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> gave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins might never make the offer, and till <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did, it was useless to quarrel about <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, no officers, no news could be sought after—the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> might have found some trial of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> acquaintance with <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>

The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball.

<p></p><p></p>
Till <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> being present had never occurred to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. The certainty of meeting <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> being purposely omitted for <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> absence was pronounced by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend Denny, to whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, "I do not imagine <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> business would have called <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> away just now, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had not wanted to avoid a certain <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> here."<p></p><p></p>
This part of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> intelligence, though unheard by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, was caught by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, and, as it assured <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that <span class="transformed">he</span> could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. <span class="transformed">He</span> was resolved against any sort of conversation with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which <span class="transformed">he</span> could not wholly surmount even in speaking to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> spirits; and having told all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> griefs to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> Lucas, whom <span class="transformed">he</span> had not seen for a week, <span class="transformed">he</span> was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> cousin, and to point <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> out to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> particular notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> release from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> was ecstasy.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was universally liked. When those dances were over, <span class="transformed">he</span> returned to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> Lucas, and was in conversation with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, when <span class="transformed">he</span> found <span class="transformed">himself</span> suddenly addressed by <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy who took <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> so much by surprise in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> application for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> hand, that, without knowing what <span class="transformed">he</span> did, <span class="transformed">he</span> accepted <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> walked away again immediately, and <span class="transformed">he</span> was left to fret over <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own want of presence of mind; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> tried to console <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>:<p></p><p></p>
"I dare say you will find <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> very agreeable."<p></p><p></p>
"Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an evil."<p></p><p></p>
When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> hand, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> could not help cautioning <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> fancy for Wickham to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> appear unpleasant in the eyes of a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> ten times <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> consequence. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> made no answer, and took <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which <span class="transformed">he</span> was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, and reading in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and <span class="transformed">he</span> began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> partner to oblige <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to talk, <span class="transformed">he</span> made some slight observation on the dance. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, <span class="transformed">he</span> addressed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> a second time with:—"It is your turn to say something now, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy. I talked about the dance, and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> smiled, and assured <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that whatever <span class="transformed">he</span> wished <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to say should be said.<p></p><p></p>
"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But now we may be silent."<p></p><p></p>
"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?"<p></p><p></p>
"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of some, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible."<p></p><p></p>
"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"<p></p><p></p>
"Both," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> archly; "for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."<p></p><p></p>
"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>. "How near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say. You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."<p></p><p></p>
"I must not decide on my own performance."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> asked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> if <span class="transformed">he</span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> did not very often walk to Meryton. <span class="transformed">He</span> answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance."<p></p><p></p>
The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> features, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> said not a word, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, though blaming <span class="transformed">himself</span> for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, "<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> making friends—whether <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> may be equally capable of retaining them, is less certain."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> with emphasis, "and in a manner which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is likely to suffer from all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> life."<p></p><p></p>
Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that moment, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> dancing and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> partner.<p></p><p></p>
"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>. Such very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>. You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."<p></p><p></p>
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span>'s allusion to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend seemed to strike <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> forcibly, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, who were dancing together. Recovering <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, however, shortly, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> turned to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> partner, and said, "<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span>'s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."<p></p><p></p>
"I do not think we were speaking at all. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."<p></p><p></p>
"What think you of books?" said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, smiling.<p></p><p></p>
"Books—oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings."<p></p><p></p>
"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions."<p></p><p></p>
"No—I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else."<p></p><p></p>
"The present always occupies you in such scenes—does it?" said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, with a look of doubt.<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, always," <span class="transformed">he</span> replied, without knowing what <span class="transformed">he</span> said, for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created."<p></p><p></p>
"I am," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, with a firm voice.<p></p><p></p>
"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"<p></p><p></p>
"I hope not."<p></p><p></p>
"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first."<p></p><p></p>
"May I ask to what these questions tend?"<p></p><p></p>
"Merely to the illustration of your character," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, endeavouring to shake off <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> gravity. "I am trying to make it out."<p></p><p></p>
"And what is your success?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> shook <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> head. "I do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."<p></p><p></p>
"I can readily believe," answered <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> gravely, "that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."<p></p><p></p>
"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity."<p></p><p></p>
"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> coldly replied. <span class="transformed">He</span> said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, which soon procured <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> pardon, and directed all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> anger against another.<p></p><p></p>
They had not long separated, when <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley came towards <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>:<p></p><p></p>
"So, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Georgiana</span></span> Wickham! Your <span class="transformed">brother</span> has been talking to me about <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> quite forgot to tell you, among <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> other communication, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span> of old Wickham, the late <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">stewardess</span></span>. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> assertions; for as to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's using <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has always been remarkably kind to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Georgiana</span></span> Wickham has treated <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> cannot bear to hear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Georgiana</span></span> Wickham mentioned, and that though my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> thought that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could not well avoid including <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> invitation to the officers, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was excessively glad to find that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had taken <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> out of the way. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could presume to do it. I pity you, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really, considering <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> descent, one could not expect much better."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> guilt and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> descent appear by your account to be the same," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> angrily; "for I have heard you accuse <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> of nothing worse than of being the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span> of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">stewardess</span></span>, and of that, I can assure you, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> informed me <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"I beg your pardon," replied <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley, turning away with a sneer. "Excuse my interference—it was kindly meant."<p></p><p></p>
"Insolent <span class="transformed">boy</span>!" said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> to <span class="transformed">himself</span>. "You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy." <span class="transformed">He</span> then sought <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eldest <span class="transformed">brother</span>, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> met <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well <span class="transformed">he</span> was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> instantly read <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s being in the fairest way for happiness.<p></p><p></p>
"I want to know," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, with a countenance no less smiling than <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s, "what you have learnt about <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon."<p></p><p></p>
"No," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, "I have not forgotten <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley does not know the whole of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend, and is perfectly convinced that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham has deserved much less attention from <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has received; and I am sorry to say by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> account as well as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham is by no means a respectable young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>. I am afraid <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's regard."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley does not know <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"No; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> never saw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> till the other morning at Meryton."<p></p><p></p>
"This account then is what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has received from <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> say of the living?"<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has heard them from <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy more than once, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> believes that it was left to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> conditionally only."<p></p><p></p>
"I have not a doubt of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's sincerity," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's defense of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, I shall venture to still think of both <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> as I did before."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> entertained of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's regard, and said all in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> power to heighten <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> confidence in it. On their being joined by <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> withdrew to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> last partner <span class="transformed">he</span> had scarcely replied, before <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins came up to them, and told <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with great exultation that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.<p></p><p></p>
"I have found out," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> mentioning to the young <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> who does the honours of the house the names of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousin <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh, and of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span> of <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, which I am now going to do, and trust <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."<p></p><p></p>
"You are not going to introduce yourself to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy!"<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed I am. I shall entreat <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to be <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>'s <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span>. It will be in my power to assure <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> tried hard to dissuade <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> from such a scheme, assuring <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy would consider <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> addressing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span>; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins listened to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with the determined air of following <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own inclination, and, when <span class="transformed">he</span> ceased speaking, replied thus:<p></p><p></p>
"My dear <span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> like yourself." And with a low bow <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> left <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to attack <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, whose reception of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> advances <span class="transformed">he</span> eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> cousin prefaced <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> speech with a solemn bow and though <span class="transformed">he</span> could not hear a word of it, <span class="transformed">he</span> felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> lips the words "apology," "Hunsford," and "<span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> de Bourgh." It vexed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> expose <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> to such a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy was eyeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> with unrestrained wonder, and when at last <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins allowed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> second speech, and at the end of it <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> only made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> a slight bow, and moved another way. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins then returned to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"I have no reason, I assure you," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "to be dissatisfied with my reception. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was so well convinced of <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>'s discernment as to be certain <span class="transformed">he</span> could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
As <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had no longer any interest of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own to pursue, <span class="transformed">he</span> turned <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> attention almost entirely on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> observations gave birth to, made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> perhaps almost as happy as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> saw <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and <span class="transformed">he</span> felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two <span class="transformed">brothers</span>. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>'s thoughts <span class="transformed">he</span> plainly saw were bent the same way, and <span class="transformed">he</span> determined not to venture near <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, lest <span class="transformed">he</span> might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, <span class="transformed">he</span> considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was <span class="transformed">he</span> vexed to find that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> was talking to that one person (<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span>) freely, openly, and of nothing else but <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> expectation that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> would soon be married to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> being such a charming young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two <span class="transformed">brothers</span> were of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as <span class="transformed">he</span> could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> younger <span class="transformed">sons</span>, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span>; and lastly, it was so pleasant at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> time of life to be able to consign <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> single <span class="transformed">sons</span> to the care of their <span class="transformed">brother</span>, that <span class="transformed">he</span> might not be obliged to go into company more than <span class="transformed">he</span> liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> life. <span class="transformed">He</span> concluded with many good wishes that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span> might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.<p></p><p></p>
In vain did <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> endeavour to check the rapidity of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>'s words, or persuade <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to describe <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> inexpressible vexation, <span class="transformed">he</span> could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> only scolded <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for being nonsensical.<p></p><p></p>
"What is <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>? I am sure we owe <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> may not like to hear."<p></p><p></p>
"For heaven's sake, <span class="transformed">sir</span>, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you to offend <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend by so doing!"<p></p><p></p>
Nothing that <span class="transformed">he</span> could say, however, had any influence. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> would talk of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> views in the same intelligible tone. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. <span class="transformed">He</span> could not help frequently glancing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eye at <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, though every glance convinced <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> of what <span class="transformed">he</span> dreaded; for though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was not always looking at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> was convinced that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attention was invariably fixed by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. The expression of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.<p></p><p></p>
At length, however, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet had no more to say; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span>, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which <span class="transformed">he</span> saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and <span class="transformed">he</span> had the mortification of seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span>, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did <span class="transformed">he</span> endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and <span class="transformed">he</span> began <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> song. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s eyes were fixed on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with most painful sensations, and <span class="transformed">he</span> watched <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span>, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that <span class="transformed">he</span> might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span>'s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> voice was weak, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> manner affected. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was in agonies. <span class="transformed">He</span> looked at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, to see how <span class="transformed">he</span> bore it; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was very composedly talking to Bingley. <span class="transformed">He</span> looked at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> two <span class="transformed">brothers</span>, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave. <span class="transformed">He</span> looked at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> to entreat <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> interference, lest <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> should be singing all night. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> took the hint, and when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> had finished <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> second song, said aloud, "That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> have time to exhibit."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span>, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, sorry for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and sorry for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s speech, was afraid <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.<p></p><p></p>
"If I," said <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> and not offensive to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> patron. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> must write <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> parish duties, and the care and improvement of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> dwelling, which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> owes <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> preferment. I cannot acquit <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> of that duty; nor could I think well of the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> who should omit an occasion of testifying <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> respect towards anybody connected with the family." And with a bow to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> concluded <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared—many smiled; but no one looked more amused than <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, while <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span> seriously commended <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span>, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was a remarkably clever, good kind of young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
To <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> it appeared that, had <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did <span class="transformed">he</span> think it for Bingley and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> that some of the exhibition had escaped <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> notice, and that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must have witnessed. That <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> two <span class="transformed">brothers</span> and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> relations, was bad enough, and <span class="transformed">he</span> could not determine whether the silent contempt of the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>, or the insolent smiles of the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span>, were more intolerable.<p></p><p></p>
The rest of the evening brought <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> little amusement. <span class="transformed">He</span> was teased by <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> side, and though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could not prevail on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to dance with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> again, put it out of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> power to dance with others. In vain did <span class="transformed">he</span> entreat <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to any young <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> in the room. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> assured <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, that as to dancing, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was perfectly indifferent to it; that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> and that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should therefore make a point of remaining close to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. <span class="transformed">He</span> owed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> greatest relief to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's conversation to <span class="transformed">himself</span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> was at least free from the offense of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's further notice; though often standing within a very short distance of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, quite disengaged, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> never came near enough to speak. <span class="transformed">He</span> felt it to be the probable consequence of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> allusions to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.<p></p><p></p>
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a manoeuvre of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, who was complimenting <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> preserved as steady a silence as either <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst or <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley; and even <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord, how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.<p></p><p></p>
When at length they arose to take leave, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was most pressingly civil in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and addressed <span class="transformed">himself</span> especially to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, to assure <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> how happy <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, after <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> return from London, whither <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was obliged to go the next day for a short time.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, <span class="transformed">he</span> should undoubtedly see <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span> settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of having another <span class="transformed">son</span> married to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, <span class="transformed">he</span> thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was the least dear to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> of all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> children; and though the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> and the match were quite good enough for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, the worth of each was eclipsed by <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley and Netherfield.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, "I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here."<p></p><p></p>
This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.<p></p><p></p>
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy.<p></p><p></p>
She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her:<p></p><p></p>
"I dare say you will find him very agreeable."<p></p><p></p>
"Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an evil."<p></p><p></p>
When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours' looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with:—"It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked about the dance, and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples."<p></p><p></p>
He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.<p></p><p></p>
"Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But now we may be silent."<p></p><p></p>
"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?"<p></p><p></p>
"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of some, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible."<p></p><p></p>
"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"<p></p><p></p>
"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."<p></p><p></p>
"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure," said he. "How near it may be to mine, I cannot pretend to say. You think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."<p></p><p></p>
"I must not decide on my own performance."<p></p><p></p>
He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added, "When you met us there the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance."<p></p><p></p>
The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, "Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends—whether he may be equally capable of retaining them, is less certain."<p></p><p></p>
"He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship," replied Elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life."<p></p><p></p>
Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner.<p></p><p></p>
"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."<p></p><p></p>
The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said, "Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."<p></p><p></p>
"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."<p></p><p></p>
"What think you of books?" said he, smiling.<p></p><p></p>
"Books—oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings."<p></p><p></p>
"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject. We may compare our different opinions."<p></p><p></p>
"No—I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else."<p></p><p></p>
"The present always occupies you in such scenes—does it?" said he, with a look of doubt.<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, always," she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming, "I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created."<p></p><p></p>
"I am," said he, with a firm voice.<p></p><p></p>
"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"<p></p><p></p>
"I hope not."<p></p><p></p>
"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first."<p></p><p></p>
"May I ask to what these questions tend?"<p></p><p></p>
"Merely to the illustration of your character," said she, endeavouring to shake off her gravity. "I am trying to make it out."<p></p><p></p>
"And what is your success?"<p></p><p></p>
She shook her head. "I do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."<p></p><p></p>
"I can readily believe," answered he gravely, "that reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."<p></p><p></p>
"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity."<p></p><p></p>
"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours," he coldly replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy's breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another.<p></p><p></p>
They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her:<p></p><p></p>
"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy's steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy's using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much better."<p></p><p></p>
"His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same," said Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of that, I can assure you, he informed me himself."<p></p><p></p>
"I beg your pardon," replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer. "Excuse my interference—it was kindly meant."<p></p><p></p>
"Insolent girl!" said Elizabeth to herself. "You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy." She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness.<p></p><p></p>
"I want to know," said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister's, "what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon."<p></p><p></p>
"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister's, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard."<p></p><p></p>
"Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?"<p></p><p></p>
"No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."<p></p><p></p>
"This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?"<p></p><p></p>
"He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him conditionally only."<p></p><p></p>
"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity," said Elizabeth warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr. Bingley's defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before."<p></p><p></p>
She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley's regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery.<p></p><p></p>
"I have found out," said he, "by a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."<p></p><p></p>
"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!"<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine's nephew. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se'nnight."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking, replied thus:<p></p><p></p>
"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself." And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words "apology," "Hunsford," and "Lady Catherine de Bourgh." It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy's contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.<p></p><p></p>
"I have no reason, I assure you," said he, "to be dissatisfied with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine's discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him."<p></p><p></p>
As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley's two sisters. Her mother's thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane's marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it.<p></p><p></p>
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother's words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.<p></p><p></p>
"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear."<p></p><p></p>
"For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!"<p></p><p></p>
Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity.<p></p><p></p>
At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth's eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another. Mary's powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, "That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."<p></p><p></p>
Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.<p></p><p></p>
"If I," said Mr. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family." And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared—many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.<p></p><p></p>
To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.<p></p><p></p>
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room. He assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it; that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins's conversation to herself.<p></p><p></p>
She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy's further notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it.<p></p><p></p>
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord, how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.<p></p><p></p>
When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> even at the moment, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances, which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> supposed a regular part of the business. On finding <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, and one of the younger <span class="transformed">boys</span> together, soon after breakfast, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> addressed the <span class="transformed">father</span> in these words:<p></p><p></p>
"May I hope, <span class="transformed">sir</span>, for your interest with your fair <span class="transformed">son</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in the course of this morning?"<p></p><p></p>
Before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had time for anything but a blush of surprise, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet answered instantly, "Oh dear!—yes—certainly. I am sure <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span> will be very happy—I am sure <span class="transformed">he</span> can have no objection. Come, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, I want you up stairs." And, gathering <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> work together, <span class="transformed">he</span> was hastening away, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> called out:<p></p><p></p>
"Dear <span class="transformed">sir</span>, do not go. I beg you will not go. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins must excuse me. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going away myself."<p></p><p></p>
"No, no, nonsense, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>. I desire you to stay where you are." And upon <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, <span class="transformed">he</span> added: "<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, I insist upon your staying and hearing <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment's consideration making <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, <span class="transformed">he</span> sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> walked off, and as soon as they were gone, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins began.<p></p><p></p>
"Believe me, my dear <span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected <span class="transformed">father</span>'s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying—and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a <span class="transformed">husband</span>, as I certainly did."<p></p><p></p>
The idea of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, with all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> solemn composure, being run away with by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> feelings, made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> so near laughing, that <span class="transformed">he</span> could not use the short pause <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> allowed in any attempt to stop <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> further, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> continued:<p></p><p></p>
"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has <span class="transformed">he</span> condescended to give me <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Jenkinson was arranging <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh's footstool, that <span class="transformed">he</span> said, '<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a <span class="transformed">man</span> as soon as you can, bring <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to Hunsford, and I will visit <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young <span class="transformed">men</span>. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a <span class="transformed">husband</span> from among <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">sons</span>, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your <span class="transformed">father</span>'s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."<p></p><p></p>
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> now.<p></p><p></p>
"You are too hasty, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>," <span class="transformed">he</span> cried. "You forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them."<p></p><p></p>
"I am not now to learn," replied <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> to reject the addresses of the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> whom they secretly mean to accept, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."<p></p><p></p>
"Upon my word, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> (if such young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the last <span class="transformed">man</span> in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your friend <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> to know me, I am persuaded <span class="transformed">he</span> would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation."<p></p><p></p>
"Were it certain that <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> would think so," said <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins very gravely—"but I cannot imagine that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification."<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as <span class="transformed">he</span> thus spoke, <span class="transformed">he</span> would have quitted the room, had <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins not thus addressed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>:<p></p><p></p>
"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the <span class="transformed">male</span> character."<p></p><p></p>
"Really, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one."<p></p><p></p>
"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant <span class="transformed">males</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"I do assure you, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant <span class="transformed">male</span>, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> heart."<p></p><p></p>
"You are uniformly charming!" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, with an air of awkward gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable."<p></p><p></p>
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> persisted in considering <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant <span class="transformed">male</span>.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:<p></p><p></p>
"May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?"<p></p><p></p>
Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, "Oh dear!—yes—certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy—I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs." And, gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out:<p></p><p></p>
"Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going away myself."<p></p><p></p>
"No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are." And upon Elizabeth's seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: "Lizzy, I insist upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction—and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began.<p></p><p></p>
"Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying—and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did."<p></p><p></p>
The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he continued:<p></p><p></p>
"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly—which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford—between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh's footstool, that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for my sake; and for your own, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place—which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother's decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married."<p></p><p></p>
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.<p></p><p></p>
"You are too hasty, sir," she cried. "You forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them."<p></p><p></p>
"I am not now to learn," replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, "that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."<p></p><p></p>
"Upon my word, sir," cried Elizabeth, "your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make me happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who could make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation."<p></p><p></p>
"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so," said Mr. Collins very gravely—"but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of seeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualification."<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled." And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her:<p></p><p></p>
"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character."<p></p><p></p>
"Really, Mr. Collins," cried Elizabeth with some warmth, "you puzzle me exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one."<p></p><p></p>
"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for believing it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections with the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further consideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."<p></p><p></p>
"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart."<p></p><p></p>
"You are uniformly charming!" cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; "and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable."<p></p><p></p>
To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> successful love; for <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> open the door and with quick step pass <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> towards the staircase, than <span class="transformed">he</span> entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> and <span class="transformed">himself</span> in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> trusted <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousin had steadfastly given <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> would naturally flow from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> character.<p></p><p></p>
This information, however, startled <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet; <span class="transformed">he</span> would have been glad to be equally satisfied that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span> had meant to encourage <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> by protesting against <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> proposals, but <span class="transformed">he</span> dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.<p></p><p></p>
"But, depend upon it, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins," <span class="transformed">he</span> added, "that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span> shall be brought to reason. I will speak to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> about it directly. <span class="transformed">He</span> is a very headstrong, foolish <span class="transformed">boy</span>, and does not know <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own interest but I will make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> know it."<p></p><p></p>
"Pardon me for interrupting you, <span class="transformed">sir</span>," cried <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins; "but if <span class="transformed">he</span> is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether <span class="transformed">he</span> would altogether be a very desirable <span class="transformed">husband</span> to a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore <span class="transformed">he</span> actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not contribute much to my felicity."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Madam</span></span>, you quite misunderstand me," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, alarmed. "<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span> is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else <span class="transformed">he</span> is as good-natured a <span class="transformed">boy</span> as ever lived. I will go directly to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, I am sure."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> would not give <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> time to reply, but hurrying instantly to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>, called out as <span class="transformed">he</span> entered the library, "Oh! <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span> marry <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, for <span class="transformed">he</span> vows <span class="transformed">he</span> will not have <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and if you do not make haste <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will change <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> mind and not have <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet raised <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> eyes from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> book as <span class="transformed">he</span> entered, and fixed them on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> communication.<p></p><p></p>
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, when <span class="transformed">he</span> had finished <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> speech. "Of what are you talking?"<p></p><p></p>
"Of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span> declares <span class="transformed">he</span> will not have <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins begins to say that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will not have <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business."<p></p><p></p>
"Speak to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span> about it yourself. Tell <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that you insist upon <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> marrying <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Let <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> be called down. <span class="transformed">He</span> shall hear my opinion."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet rang the bell, and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was summoned to the library.<p></p><p></p>
"Come here, child," cried <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> as <span class="transformed">he</span> appeared. "I have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?" <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> replied that it was. "Very well—and this offer of marriage you have refused?"<p></p><p></p>
"I have, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Very well. We now come to the point. Your <span class="transformed">father</span> insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, or I will never see <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> again."<p></p><p></p>
"An unhappy alternative is before you, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your <span class="transformed">father</span> will never see you again if you do not marry <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, who had persuaded <span class="transformed">himself</span> that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> regarded the affair as <span class="transformed">he</span> wished, was excessively disappointed.<p></p><p></p>
"What do you mean, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to insist upon <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> marrying <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"My dear," replied <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>, "I have two small favours to request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be."<p></p><p></p>
Not yet, however, in spite of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> disappointment in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>, did <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet give up the point. <span class="transformed">He</span> talked to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> again and again; coaxed and threatened <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> by turns. <span class="transformed">He</span> endeavoured to secure <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> interest; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, with all possible mildness, declined interfering; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> attacks. Though <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> manner varied, however, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> determination never did.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> thought too well of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> to comprehend on what motives <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousin could refuse <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; and though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> pride was hurt, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> suffered in no other way. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> regard for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> was quite imaginary; and the possibility of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> deserving <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>'s reproach prevented <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> feeling any regret.<p></p><p></p>
While the family were in this confusion, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> Lucas came to spend the day with them. <span class="transformed">He</span> was met in the vestibule by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, who, flying to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins has made an offer to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, and <span class="transformed">he</span> will not have <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was alone, than <span class="transformed">he</span> likewise began on the subject, calling on <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> compassion, and entreating <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to persuade <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span> to comply with the wishes of all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family. "Pray do, my dear <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas," <span class="transformed">he</span> added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>'s reply was spared by the entrance of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"Aye, there <span class="transformed">he</span> comes," continued <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided <span class="transformed">he</span> can have <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own way. But I tell you, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>—if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> at all—and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> is dead. I shall not be able to keep you—and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed">sons</span> listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> or soothe <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> would only increase the irritation. <span class="transformed">He</span> talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them, till they were joined by <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, who entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, <span class="transformed">he</span> said to the <span class="transformed">boys</span>, "Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins have a little conversation together."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> passed quietly out of the room, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> followed, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> stood <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ground, determined to hear all <span class="transformed">he</span> could; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>, detained first by the civility of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, whose inquiries after <span class="transformed">himself</span> and all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied <span class="transformed">himself</span> with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a doleful voice <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet began the projected conversation: "Oh! <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins!"<p></p><p></p>
"My dear <span class="transformed">sir</span>," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "let us be for ever silent on this point. Far be it from me," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> presently continued, in a voice that marked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your <span class="transformed">son</span>. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear <span class="transformed">sir</span>, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your <span class="transformed">son</span>'s favour, without having paid yourself and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your <span class="transformed">son</span>'s lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."<p></p><p></p>

Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.<p></p><p></p>
This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it, and could not help saying so.<p></p><p></p>
"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins," she added, "that Lizzy shall be brought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will make her know it."<p></p><p></p>
"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam," cried Mr. Collins; "but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity."<p></p><p></p>
"Sir, you quite misunderstand me," said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. "Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure."<p></p><p></p>
She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her husband, called out as she entered the library, "Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication.<p></p><p></p>
"I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he, when she had finished her speech. "Of what are you talking?"<p></p><p></p>
"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy."<p></p><p></p>
"And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business."<p></p><p></p>
"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him."<p></p><p></p>
"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion."<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.<p></p><p></p>
"Come here, child," cried her father as she appeared. "I have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?" Elizabeth replied that it was. "Very well—and this offer of marriage you have refused?"<p></p><p></p>
"I have, sir."<p></p><p></p>
"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, or I will never see her again."<p></p><p></p>
"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.<p></p><p></p>
"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to insist upon her marrying him."<p></p><p></p>
"My dear," replied her husband, "I have two small favours to request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be."<p></p><p></p>
Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again; coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner varied, however, her determination never did.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed. He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother's reproach prevented his feeling any regret.<p></p><p></p>
While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him."<p></p><p></p>
Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family. "Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas," she added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels for my poor nerves."<p></p><p></p>
Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.<p></p><p></p>
"Aye, there she comes," continued Mrs. Bennet, "looking as unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy—if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all—and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep you—and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied."<p></p><p></p>
Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls, "Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation together."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: "Oh! Mr. Collins!"<p></p><p></p>
"My dear madam," replied he, "let us be for ever silent on this point. Far be it from me," he presently continued, in a voice that marked his displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughter's favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughter's lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my manner has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise."<p></p><p></p>

The discussion of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>. As for the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> scarcely ever spoke to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and the assiduous attentions which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been so sensible of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> were transferred for the rest of the day to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas, whose civility in listening to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend.<p></p><p></p>
The morrow produced no abatement of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet's ill-humour or ill health. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had hoped that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> resentment might shorten <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> visit, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> plan did not appear in the least affected by it. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> meant to stay.<p></p><p></p>
After breakfast, the <span class="transformed">boys</span> walked to Meryton to inquire if <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham were returned, and to lament over <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> absence from the Netherfield ball. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their <span class="transformed">uncle</span>'s where <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over. To <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, however, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> absence had been self-imposed.<p></p><p></p>
"I found," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "as the time drew near that I had better not meet <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> highly approved <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> particularly attended to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> accompanying them was a double advantage; <span class="transformed">he</span> felt all the compliment it offered to <span class="transformed">himself</span>, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> and <span class="transformed">father</span>.<p></p><p></p>
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet; it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>'s fair, flowing hand; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> saw <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s countenance change as <span class="transformed">he</span> read it, and saw <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> dwelling intently on some particular passages. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> recollected <span class="transformed">himself</span> soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> companion taken leave, than a glance from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> invited <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to follow <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> up stairs. When they had gained their own room, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, taking out the letter, said:<p></p><p></p>
"This is from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Carl</span></span> Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town—and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what <span class="transformed">he</span> says."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words: "I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that." To these highflown expressions <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, <span class="transformed">he</span> was persuaded that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"It is unlucky," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, after a short pause, "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than <span class="transformed">he</span> is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as <span class="transformed">brothers</span>? <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley will not be detained in London by them."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Carl</span></span> decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:"<p></p><p></p>
"When my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> left us yesterday, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> imagined that the business which took <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> thither, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> may not be obliged to spend <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd—but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you."<p></p><p></p>
"It is evident by this," added <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, "that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> comes back no more this winter."<p></p><p></p>
"It is only evident that <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley does not mean that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should."<p></p><p></p>
"Why will you think so? It must be <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own doing. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span>. But you do not know all. I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from you."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy is impatient to see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>; and, to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection <span class="transformed">he</span> inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> being hereafter our <span class="transformed">brother</span>. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> admires <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> greatly already; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will have frequent opportunity now of seeing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> on the most intimate footing; <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> relations all wish the connection as much as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own; and a <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any <span class="transformed">man</span>'s heart. With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?"<p></p><p></p>
"What do you think of this sentence, my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>?" said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> as <span class="transformed">he</span> finished it. "Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Carl</span></span> neither expects nor wishes me to be <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>; that <span class="transformed">he</span> is perfectly convinced of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>'s indifference; and that if <span class="transformed">he</span> suspects the nature of my feelings for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?"<p></p><p></p>
"Most willingly."<p></p><p></p>
"You shall have it in a few words. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley sees that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> is in love with you, and wants <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to marry <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy. <span class="transformed">He</span> follows <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to town in hope of keeping <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> there, and tries to persuade you that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> does not care about you."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> shook <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> head.<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you together can doubt <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> affection. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley, I am sure, cannot. <span class="transformed">He</span> is not such a simpleton. Could <span class="transformed">he</span> have seen half as much love in <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy for <span class="transformed">himself</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> would have ordered <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and <span class="transformed">he</span> is the more anxious to get <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage, <span class="transformed">he</span> may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, you cannot seriously imagine that because <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley tells you <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> greatly admires <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> power to persuade <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> that, instead of being in love with you, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is very much in love with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend."<p></p><p></p>
"If we thought alike of <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, "your representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Carl</span></span> is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that <span class="transformed">he</span> is deceiving <span class="transformed">himself</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to be deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and must fret no longer."<p></p><p></p>
"But, my dear <span class="transformed">brother</span>, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> whose <span class="transformed">brothers</span> and friends are all wishing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to marry elsewhere?"<p></p><p></p>
"You must decide for yourself," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; "and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> two <span class="transformed">brothers</span> is more than equivalent to the happiness of being <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>, I advise you by all means to refuse <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"How can you talk so?" said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, faintly smiling. "You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate."<p></p><p></p>
"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion."<p></p><p></p>
"But if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. A thousand things may arise in six months!"<p></p><p></p>
The idea of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> returning no more <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> treated with the utmost contempt. It appeared to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> merely the suggestion of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Carl</span></span>'s interested wishes, and <span class="transformed">he</span> could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> so totally independent of everyone.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> represented to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> as forcibly as possible what <span class="transformed">he</span> felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s temper was not desponding, and <span class="transformed">he</span> was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> heart.<p></p><p></p>
They agreed that <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>'s conduct; but even this partial communication gave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> a great deal of concern, and <span class="transformed">he</span> bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After lamenting it, however, at some length, <span class="transformed">he</span> had the consolation that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been invited only to a family dinner, <span class="transformed">he</span> would take care to have two full courses.<p></p><p></p>

The discussion of Mr. Collins's offer was now nearly at an end, and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother. As for the gentleman himself, his feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and especially to her friend.<p></p><p></p>
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet's ill-humour or ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.<p></p><p></p>
After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball. He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their aunt's where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self-imposed.<p></p><p></p>
"I found," said he, "as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself."<p></p><p></p>
She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.<p></p><p></p>
Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady's fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said:<p></p><p></p>
"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town—and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says."<p></p><p></p>
She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words: "I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that." To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.<p></p><p></p>
"It is unlucky," said she, after a short pause, "that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them."<p></p><p></p>
"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:"<p></p><p></p>
"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd—but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you."<p></p><p></p>
"It is evident by this," added Jane, "that he comes back no more this winter."<p></p><p></p>
"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he should."<p></p><p></p>
"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own master. But you do not know all. I will read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from you."<p></p><p></p>
"Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?"<p></p><p></p>
"What do you think of this sentence, my dear Lizzy?" said Jane as she finished it. "Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?"<p></p><p></p>
"Most willingly."<p></p><p></p>
"You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you."<p></p><p></p>
Jane shook her head.<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."<p></p><p></p>
"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself."<p></p><p></p>
"That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."<p></p><p></p>
"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?"<p></p><p></p>
"You must decide for yourself," said Elizabeth; "and if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him."<p></p><p></p>
"How can you talk so?" said Jane, faintly smiling. "You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate."<p></p><p></p>
"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion."<p></p><p></p>
"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required. A thousand things may arise in six months!"<p></p><p></p>
The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's interested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.<p></p><p></p>
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect. Jane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.<p></p><p></p>
They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct; but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern, and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two full courses.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day was <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas so kind as to listen to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> took an opportunity of thanking <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. "It keeps <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in good humour," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express." <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> assured <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for the little sacrifice of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> time. This was very amiable, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>'s kindness extended farther than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> from any return of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards <span class="transformed">himself</span>. Such was <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, <span class="transformed">he</span> would have felt almost secure of success if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here <span class="transformed">he</span> did injustice to the fire and independence of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> character, for it led <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feet. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was anxious to avoid the notice of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousins, from a conviction that if they saw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> depart, they could not fail to conjecture <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> design, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> had been tolerably encouraging, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas perceived <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> from an upper window as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> accidentally in the lane. But little had <span class="transformed">he</span> dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> there.<p></p><p></p>
In as short a time as <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> earnestly entreated <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to name the day that was to make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> the happiest of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span>; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present, the <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> felt no inclination to trifle with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> happiness. The stupidity with which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was favoured by nature must guard <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> courtship from any charm that could make a <span class="transformed">man</span> wish for its continuance; and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas, who accepted <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span> were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their <span class="transformed">son</span>, to whom they could give little fortune; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span> began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet was likely to live; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> gave it as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> decided opinion, that whenever <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span> should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger <span class="transformed">boys</span> formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">girls</span></span> were relieved from their apprehension of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>'s dying an old maid. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> <span class="transformed">himself</span> was tolerably composed. <span class="transformed">He</span> had gained <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> point, and had time to consider of it. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> reflections were in general satisfactory. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> society was irksome, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attachment to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> must be imaginary. But still <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would be <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>. Without thinking highly either of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span> or matrimony, marriage had always been <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> object; it was the only provision for well-educated young <span class="transformed">men</span> of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative <span class="transformed">he</span> had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> Bennet, whose friendship <span class="transformed">he</span> valued beyond that of any other person. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> would wonder, and probably would blame <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; and though <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> resolution was not to be shaken, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. <span class="transformed">He</span> resolved to give <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> the information <span class="transformed">himself</span>, and therefore charged <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> return as required some ingenuity to evade, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was longing to publish <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> prosperous love.<p></p><p></p>
As <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was to begin <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> moved for the night; and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at Longbourn again, whenever <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> engagements might allow <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to visit them.<p></p><p></p>
"My dear <span class="transformed">sir</span>," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible."<p></p><p></p>
They were all astonished; and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:<p></p><p></p>
"But is there not danger of <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>'s disapprobation here, my good <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness."<p></p><p></p>
"My dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>," replied <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship's concurrence."<p></p><p></p>
"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence."<p></p><p></p>
"Believe me, my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
With proper civilities the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> meditated a quick return. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet wished to understand by it that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> thought of paying <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> addresses to one of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> younger <span class="transformed">boys</span>, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> might have been prevailed on to accept <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> rated <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> reflections which often struck <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and though by no means so clever as <span class="transformed">himself</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> thought that if encouraged to read and improve <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> by such an example as hers, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might become a very agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> related the event of the day before.<p></p><p></p>
The possibility of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's fancying <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> in love with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend had once occurred to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> within the last day or two; but that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> could encourage <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> seemed almost as far from possibility as <span class="transformed">he</span> could encourage <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">himself</span>, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and <span class="transformed">he</span> could not help crying out:<p></p><p></p>
"Engaged to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins! My dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>—impossible!"<p></p><p></p>
The steady countenance which <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas had commanded in telling <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than <span class="transformed">he</span> expected, <span class="transformed">he</span> soon regained <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> composure, and calmly replied:<p></p><p></p>
"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins should be able to procure any <span class="transformed">man</span>'s good opinion, because <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was not so happy as to succeed with you?"<p></p><p></p>
But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had now recollected <span class="transformed">himself</span>, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and that <span class="transformed">he</span> wished <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> all imaginable happiness.<p></p><p></p>
"I see what you are feeling," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>. "You must be surprised, very much surprised—so lately as <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> quietly answered "Undoubtedly;" and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> did not stay much longer, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was then left to reflect on what <span class="transformed">he</span> had heard. It was a long time before <span class="transformed">he</span> became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> being now accepted. <span class="transformed">He</span> had always felt that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>'s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own, but <span class="transformed">he</span> had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, <span class="transformed">he</span> would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> the <span class="transformed">husband</span> of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing <span class="transformed">himself</span> and sunk in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot <span class="transformed">he</span> had chosen.<p></p><p></p>

The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. "It keeps him in good humour," said she, "and I am more obliged to you than I can express." Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but Charlotte's kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins's addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas's scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.<p></p><p></p>
In as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained.<p></p><p></p>
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins's present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James's. The whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte's dying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved to give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.<p></p><p></p>
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them.<p></p><p></p>
"My dear madam," he replied, "this invitation is particularly gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible."<p></p><p></p>
They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:<p></p><p></p>
"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness."<p></p><p></p>
"My dear sir," replied Mr. Collins, "I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."<p></p><p></p>
"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that we shall take no offence."<p></p><p></p>
"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth."<p></p><p></p>
With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.<p></p><p></p>
The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out:<p></p><p></p>
"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte—impossible!"<p></p><p></p>
The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied:<p></p><p></p>
"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"<p></p><p></p>
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness.<p></p><p></p>
"I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte. "You must be surprised, very much surprised—so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth quietly answered "Undoubtedly;" and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was sitting with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> and <span class="transformed">brothers</span>, reflecting on what <span class="transformed">he</span> had heard, and doubting whether <span class="transformed">he</span> was authorised to mention it, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> Lucas <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> appeared, sent by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">son</span>, to announce <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> unfolded the matter—to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must be entirely mistaken; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:<p></p><p></p>
"Good Lord! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span>, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins wants to marry <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span>'s good breeding carried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> through it all; and though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> begged leave to be positive as to the truth of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> information, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, feeling it incumbent on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to relieve <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> from so unpleasant a situation, now put <span class="transformed">himself</span> forward to confirm <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> account, by mentioning <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> prior knowledge of it from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> <span class="transformed">himself</span>; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> and <span class="transformed">brothers</span> by the earnestness of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> congratulations to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span>, in which <span class="transformed">he</span> was readily joined by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> remained; but no sooner had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> left them than <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, <span class="transformed">he</span> persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, <span class="transformed">he</span> was very sure that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, <span class="transformed">he</span> trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that <span class="transformed">he</span> <span class="transformed">himself</span> had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points <span class="transformed">he</span> principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing could appease <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. Nor did that day wear out <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> resentment. A week elapsed before <span class="transformed">he</span> could see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> without scolding <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, a month passed away before <span class="transformed">he</span> could speak to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> or <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span> without being rude, and many months were gone before <span class="transformed">he</span> could at all forgive their <span class="transformed">son</span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did experience <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> said, to discover that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> Lucas, whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>, and more foolish than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">son</span>!<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> confessed <span class="transformed">himself</span> a little surprised at the match; but <span class="transformed">he</span> said less of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> astonishment than of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> earnest desire for their happiness; nor could <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> persuade <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to consider it as improbable. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> were far from envying <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas, for <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span> could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet the comfort of having a <span class="transformed">son</span> well married; and <span class="transformed">he</span> called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy <span class="transformed">he</span> was, though <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.<p></p><p></p>
Between <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> disappointment in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> turn with fonder regard to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, of whose rectitude and delicacy <span class="transformed">he</span> was sure <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness <span class="transformed">he</span> grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> return.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had sent <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Carl</span></span> an early answer to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> letter, and was counting the days till <span class="transformed">he</span> might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of thanks from <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> conscience on that head, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> society that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> again at Longbourn, whither <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> added, so heartily approved <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> marriage, that <span class="transformed">he</span> wished it to take place as soon as possible, which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> trusted would be an unanswerable argument with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> amiable <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> to name an early day for making <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> the happiest of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet. On the contrary, <span class="transformed">he</span> was as much disposed to complain of it as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>. It was very strange that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. <span class="transformed">He</span> hated having visitors in the house while <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's continued absence.<p></p><p></p>
Neither <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> nor <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, and which <span class="transformed">he</span> never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.<p></p><p></p>
Even <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—but that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> would be successful in keeping <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> away. Unwilling as <span class="transformed">he</span> was to admit an idea so destructive of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> lover, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> two unfeeling <span class="transformed">brothers</span> and of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, <span class="transformed">he</span> feared, for the strength of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attachment.<p></p><p></p>
As for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s, but whatever <span class="transformed">he</span> felt <span class="transformed">he</span> was desirous of concealing, and between <span class="transformed">himself</span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, an hour seldom passed in which <span class="transformed">he</span> did not talk of Bingley, express <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> impatience for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> arrival, or even require <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> to confess that if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did not come back <span class="transformed">he</span> would think <span class="transformed">himself</span> very ill used. It needed all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> first introduction. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> company. The chief of every day was spent by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at Lucas Lodge, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> absence before the family went to bed.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of anything concerning the match threw <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> into an agony of ill-humour, and wherever <span class="transformed">he</span> went <span class="transformed">he</span> was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas was odious to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. As <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> successor in that house, <span class="transformed">he</span> regarded <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with jealous abhorrence. Whenever <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> came to see them, <span class="transformed">he</span> concluded <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever <span class="transformed">he</span> spoke in a low voice to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn <span class="transformed">himself</span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">sons</span> out of the house, as soon as <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet were dead. <span class="transformed">He</span> complained bitterly of all this to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "it is very hard to think that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> Lucas should ever be <span class="transformed">master</span> of this house, that I should be forced to make way for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and live to see <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> take <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> place in it!"<p></p><p></p>
"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor."<p></p><p></p>
This was not very consoling to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, <span class="transformed">he</span> went on as before.<p></p><p></p>
"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it."<p></p><p></p>
"What should not you mind?"<p></p><p></p>
"I should not mind anything at all."<p></p><p></p>
"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility."<p></p><p></p>
"I never can be thankful, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own <span class="transformed">sons</span>, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins too! Why should <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> have it more than anybody else?"<p></p><p></p>
"I leave it to yourself to determine," said <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet.<p></p><p></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p></p><p></p>

<p></p></article><article class="right"><p></p><h1>Chapter 23</h1><p></p><p></p>
<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter—to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:<p></p><p></p>
"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"<p></p><p></p>
Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Bennet's emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter!<p></p><p></p>
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.<p></p><p></p>
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet's sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.<p></p><p></p>
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return.<p></p><p></p>
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued absence.<p></p><p></p>
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.<p></p><p></p>
Even Elizabeth began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment.<p></p><p></p>
As for Jane, her anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth's, but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane's steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she regarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed, Mr. Bennet," said she, "it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for her, and live to see her take her place in it!"<p></p><p></p>
"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor."<p></p><p></p>
This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before.<p></p><p></p>
"I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it."<p></p><p></p>
"What should not you mind?"<p></p><p></p>
"I should not mind anything at all."<p></p><p></p>
"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility."<p></p><p></p>
"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should he have it more than anybody else?"<p></p><p></p>
"I leave it to yourself to determine," said Mr. Bennet.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>'s regret at not having had time to pay <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> respects to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friends in Hertfordshire before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> left the country.<p></p><p></p>
Hope was over, entirely over; and when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> could attend to the rest of the letter, <span class="transformed">he</span> found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> any comfort. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> many attractions were again dwelt on, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Carl</span></span> boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> former letter. <span class="transformed">He</span> wrote also with great pleasure of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>'s being an inmate of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, to whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> heart was divided between concern for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, and resentment against all others. To <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Carl</span></span>'s assertion of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>'s being partial to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy <span class="transformed">he</span> paid no credit. That <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was really fond of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> doubted no more than <span class="transformed">he</span> had ever done; and much as <span class="transformed">he</span> had always been disposed to like <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> the slave of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> designing friends, and led <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to sacrifice of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own happiness to the caprice of their inclination. Had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> thought best, but <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s was involved in it, as <span class="transformed">he</span> thought <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must be sensible <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. <span class="transformed">He</span> could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friends' interference; whether <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been aware of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s attachment, or whether it had escaped <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> observation; whatever were the case, though <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> opinion of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> must be materially affected by the difference, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s situation remained the same, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> peace equally wounded.<p></p><p></p>
A day or two passed before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had courage to speak of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feelings to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; but at last, on <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not help saying:<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, that my dear <span class="transformed">father</span> had more command over <span class="transformed">himself</span>! <span class="transformed">He</span> can have no idea of the pain <span class="transformed">he</span> gives me by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> continual reflections on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> looked at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.<p></p><p></p>
"You doubt me," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, slightly colouring; "indeed, you have no reason. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> may live in my memory as the most amiable <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> with. Thank <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Goddess</span></span>! I have not that pain. A little time, therefore—I shall certainly try to get the better."<p></p><p></p>
With a stronger voice <span class="transformed">he</span> soon added, "I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself."<p></p><p></p>
"My dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>!" exclaimed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "you are too good. Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s warm affection.<p></p><p></p>
"Nay," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "this is not fair. You wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want to think you perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>'s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!"<p></p><p></p>
"My dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's respectability, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>'s steady, prudent character. Remember that <span class="transformed">he</span> is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody's sake, that <span class="transformed">he</span> may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin."<p></p><p></p>
"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> had any regard for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, I should only think worse of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> understanding than I now do of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> heart. My dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>; you know <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the <span class="transformed">man</span> who married <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, though it is <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness."<p></p><p></p>
"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>; "and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You mentioned two instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat you, dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, not to pain me by thinking that person to blame, and saying your opinion of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. <span class="transformed">Men</span> fancy admiration means more than it does."<p></p><p></p>
"And <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span> take care that they should."<p></p><p></p>
"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."<p></p><p></p>
"I am far from attributing any part of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's conduct to design," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business."<p></p><p></p>
"And do you impute it to either of those?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can."<p></p><p></p>
"You persist, then, in supposing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> influence <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, in conjunction with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend."<p></p><p></p>
"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>? They can only wish <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> happiness; and if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is attached to me, no other <span class="transformed">man</span> can secure it."<p></p><p></p>
"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> happiness; they may wish <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to marry a <span class="transformed">boy</span> who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride."<p></p><p></p>
"Beyond a doubt, they do wish <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to choose <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have known <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>'s. What <span class="transformed">brother</span> would think <span class="transformed">himself</span> at liberty to do it, unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attached to me, they would not try to part us; if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken—or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> or <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span>. Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could not oppose such a wish; and from this time <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> did not account for it clearly, there was little chance of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ever considering it with less perplexity. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed">son</span> endeavoured to convince <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> of what <span class="transformed">he</span> did not believe <span class="transformed">himself</span>, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attentions to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> saw <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, <span class="transformed">he</span> had the same story to repeat every day. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet's best comfort was that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley must be down again in the summer.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet treated the matter differently. "So, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> one day, "your <span class="transformed">brother</span> is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. Next to being married, a <span class="transformed">boy</span> likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> a sort of distinction among <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> in the country. Let Wickham be your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."<p></p><p></p>
"Thank you, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>, but a less agreeable <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> would satisfy me. We must not all expect <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s good fortune."<p></p><p></p>
"True," said <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate <span class="transformed">father</span> who will make the most of it."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family. They saw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> often, and to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The whole of what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had already heard, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> claims on <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, and all that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had suffered from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy before they had known anything of the matter.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes—but by everybody else <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy was condemned as the worst of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Miss Bingley's letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.<p></p><p></p>
Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an inmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern for her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline's assertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however, been the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best, but her sister's was involved in it, as she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She could think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley's regard had really died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference; whether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had escaped his observation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.<p></p><p></p>
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying:<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.<p></p><p></p>
"You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed, you have no reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not that pain. A little time, therefore—I shall certainly try to get the better."<p></p><p></p>
With a stronger voice she soon added, "I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself."<p></p><p></p>

"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger security for happiness."<p></p><p></p>

"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."<p></p><p></p>
"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design," said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.

"Beyond a doubt, they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy," replied Jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing.

Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet's best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. "So, Lizzy," said he one day, "your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."<p></p><p></p>
"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's good fortune."<p></p><p></p>
"True," said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make the most of it."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known anything of the matter.<p></p><p></p>
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society of Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes—but by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.<p></p><p></p>

After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins was called from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> amiable <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> side, by preparations for the reception of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">bridegroom</span>; as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had reason to hope, that shortly after <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> the happiest of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> took leave of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> another letter of thanks.<p></p><p></p>
On the following Monday, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner was a sensible, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladylike</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, greatly superior to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> would have had difficulty in believing that a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> who lived by trade, and within view of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, who was several years younger than <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant <span class="transformed">man</span>, and a great favourite with all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> Longbourn <span class="transformed">nephews</span>. Between the two eldest and <span class="transformed">himself</span> especially, there subsisted a particular regard. They had frequently been staying with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in town.<p></p><p></p>
The first part of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner's business on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> arrival was to distribute <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done <span class="transformed">he</span> had a less active part to play. It became <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> turn to listen. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since <span class="transformed">he</span> last saw <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>. Two of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">boys</span> had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.<p></p><p></p>
"I do not blame <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>," <span class="transformed">he</span> continued, "for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> would have got <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley if <span class="transformed">he</span> could. But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>! Oh, <span class="transformed">brother</span>! It is very hard to think that <span class="transformed">he</span> might have been <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's <span class="transformed">husband</span> by this time, had it not been for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own perverseness. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> an offer in this very room, and <span class="transformed">he</span> refused <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. The consequence of it is, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span> will have a <span class="transformed">son</span> married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, <span class="transformed">brother</span>. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s correspondence with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> a slight answer, and, in compassion to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">nephews</span>, turned the conversation.<p></p><p></p>
When alone with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> afterwards, <span class="transformed">he</span> spoke more on the subject. "It seems likely to have been a desirable match for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>," said <span class="transformed">he</span>. "I am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, such as you describe <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty <span class="transformed">boy</span> for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent."<p></p><p></p>
"An excellent consolation in its way," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "but it will not do for us. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> of independent fortune to think no more of a <span class="transformed">boy</span> whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was violently in love with only a few days before."<p></p><p></p>
"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour's acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how violent was <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's love?"<p></p><p></p>
"I never saw a more promising inclination; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own ball <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> offended two or three young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span>, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to have felt. Poor <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>! I am sorry for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, because, with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> disposition, <span class="transformed">he</span> may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to you, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think <span class="transformed">he</span> would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service—and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s ready acquiescence.<p></p><p></p>
"I hope," added <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> will influence <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> really comes to see <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"And that is quite impossible; for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is now in the custody of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend, and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy would no more suffer <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to call on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> in such a part of London! My dear <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, how could you think of it? <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> from its impurities, were <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> once to enter it; and depend upon it, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley never stirs without <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> correspond with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>? <span class="transformed">He</span> will not be able to help calling."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">He</span> will drop the acquaintance entirely."<p></p><p></p>
But in spite of the certainty in which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, on examination, that <span class="transformed">he</span> did not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes <span class="transformed">he</span> thought it probable, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> affection might be reanimated, and the influence of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s attractions.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet accepted <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span>'s invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> thoughts at the same time, than as <span class="transformed">he</span> hoped by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Carl</span></span>'s not living in the same house with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> might occasionally spend a morning with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, without any danger of seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> and <span class="transformed">brother</span>, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it—of which officers <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what <span class="transformed">he</span> saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> a little uneasy; and <span class="transformed">he</span> resolved to speak to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> on the subject before <span class="transformed">he</span> left Hertfordshire, and represent to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.<p></p><p></p>
To <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago, before <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> marriage, <span class="transformed">he</span> had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> belonged. They had, therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcy's <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, it was yet in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> power to give <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> fresher intelligence of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> former friends than <span class="transformed">he</span> had been in the way of procuring.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy by character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse. In comparing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, <span class="transformed">he</span> was delighting both <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> and <span class="transformed">himself</span>. On being made acquainted with the present <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's treatment of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> tried to remember some of that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>'s reputed disposition when quite a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lass</span></span> which might agree with it, and was confident at last that <span class="transformed">he</span> recollected having heard <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span> Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">girl</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>

After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks.<p></p><p></p>
On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town.<p></p><p></p>

The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement.

On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner's caution to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> alone; after honestly telling <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> what <span class="transformed">he</span> thought, <span class="transformed">he</span> thus went on:<p></p><p></p>
"You are too sensible a <span class="transformed">boy</span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is a most interesting young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>; and if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had the fortune <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> would depend on your resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"My dear <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, this is being serious indeed."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."<p></p><p></p>
"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham too. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, you are not serious now."<p></p><p></p>
"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> I ever saw—and if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> becomes really attached to me—I believe it will be better that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! that abominable <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy! My <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, however, is partial to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham. In short, my dear <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> first object. When I am in company with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best."<p></p><p></p>
"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> coming here so very often. At least, you should not remind your <span class="transformed">father</span> of inviting <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"As I did the other day," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> with a conscious smile: "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not imagine that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is always here so often. It is on your account that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has been so frequently invited this week. You know my <span class="transformed">father</span>'s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span> assured <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that <span class="transformed">he</span> was, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> having thanked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for the kindness of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>; but as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> took up <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> abode with the Lucases, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> arrival was no great inconvenience to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> marriage was now fast approaching, and <span class="transformed">he</span> was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that <span class="transformed">he</span> "wished they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas paid <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> farewell visit; and when <span class="transformed">he</span> rose to take leave, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, ashamed of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>'s ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected <span class="transformed">himself</span>, accompanied <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> out of the room. As they went downstairs together, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> said:<p></p><p></p>
"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."<p></p><p></p>
"That you certainly shall."<p></p><p></p>
"And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?"<p></p><p></p>
"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."<p></p><p></p>
"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could not refuse, though <span class="transformed">he</span> foresaw little pleasure in the visit.<p></p><p></p>
"My <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> and Maria are coming to me in March," added <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>, "and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them."<p></p><p></p>
The wedding took place; the <span class="transformed">bridegroom</span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">bride</span></span> set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> soon heard from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could never address <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>'s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how <span class="transformed">he</span> would speak of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> new home, how <span class="transformed">he</span> would like <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, and how happy <span class="transformed">he</span> would dare pronounce <span class="transformed">himself</span> to be; though, when the letters were read, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> felt that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> expressed <span class="transformed">himself</span> on every point exactly as <span class="transformed">he</span> might have foreseen. <span class="transformed">He</span> wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which <span class="transformed">he</span> could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> taste, and <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>'s behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> perceived that <span class="transformed">he</span> must wait for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own visit there to know the rest.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had already written a few lines to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> to announce their safe arrival in London; and when <span class="transformed">he</span> wrote again, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> hoped it would be in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> power to say something of the Bingleys.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Carl</span></span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> accounted for it, however, by supposing that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> last letter to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost.<p></p><p></p>
"My <span class="transformed">uncle</span>," <span class="transformed">he</span> continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> wrote again when the visit was paid, and <span class="transformed">he</span> had seen <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley. "I did not think <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Carl</span></span> in spirits," were <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> words, "but <span class="transformed">he</span> was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. I inquired after their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, of course. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was well, but so much engaged with <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. I found that <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. My visit was not long, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Carl</span></span> and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall see them soon here."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> shook <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> head over this letter. It convinced <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that accident only could discover to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s being in town.<p></p><p></p>
Four weeks passed away, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> saw nothing of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> endeavoured to persuade <span class="transformed">himself</span> that <span class="transformed">he</span> did not regret it; but <span class="transformed">he</span> could no longer be blind to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> stay, and yet more, the alteration of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> manner would allow <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> to deceive <span class="transformed">himself</span> no longer. The letter which <span class="transformed">he</span> wrote on this occasion to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> will prove what <span class="transformed">he</span> felt.<p></p><p></p>
"My dearest <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span> will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear <span class="transformed">brother</span>, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Carl</span></span> did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When <span class="transformed">he</span> did come, it was very evident that <span class="transformed">he</span> had no pleasure in it; <span class="transformed">he</span> made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when <span class="transformed">he</span> went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> was very wrong in singling me out as <span class="transformed">he</span> did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> side. But I pity <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, because <span class="transformed">he</span> must feel that <span class="transformed">he</span> has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if <span class="transformed">he</span> feels it, it will easily account for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, whatever anxiety <span class="transformed">he</span> must feel on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> having any such fears now, because, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something <span class="transformed">he</span> said <span class="transformed">himself</span>; and yet it would seem, by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> manner of talking, as if <span class="transformed">he</span> wanted to persuade <span class="transformed">himself</span> that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is really partial to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy—your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span>. Let me hear from you very soon. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley said something of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.—Yours, etc."<p></p><p></p>
This letter gave <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> some pain; but <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> spirits returned as <span class="transformed">he</span> considered that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> would no longer be duped, by the <span class="transformed">brother</span> at least. All expectation from the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> was now absolutely over. <span class="transformed">He</span> would not even wish for a renewal of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attentions. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, as well as a possible advantage to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> seriously hoped <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might really soon marry <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's <span class="transformed">brother</span>, as by Wickham's account, <span class="transformed">he</span> would make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> abundantly regret what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had thrown away.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner about this time reminded <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> promise concerning that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>, and required information; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had such to send as might rather give contentment to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span> than to <span class="transformed">himself</span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> apparent partiality had subsided, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attentions were over, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was the admirer of some one else. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was watchful enough to see it all, but <span class="transformed">he</span> could see it and write of it without material pain. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> heart had been but slightly touched, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> vanity was satisfied with believing that <span class="transformed">he</span> would have been <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> to whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was now rendering <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> agreeable; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>'s, did not quarrel with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> a few struggles to relinquish <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> happy.<p></p><p></p>
All this was acknowledged to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, <span class="transformed">he</span> thus went on: "I am now convinced, my dear <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> very name, and wish <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; they are even impartial towards <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Mr King</span></span>. I cannot find out that I hate <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> a very good sort of <span class="transformed">boy</span>. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> take <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span> must have something to live on as well as the plain."<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:<p></p><p></p>
"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against him; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father."<p></p><p></p>
"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."<p></p><p></p>
"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it."<p></p><p></p>
"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."<p></p><p></p>
"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw—and if he becomes really attached to me—I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! that abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best."<p></p><p></p>
"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not remind your mother of inviting him."<p></p><p></p>
"As I did the other day," said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: "very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from that. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied."<p></p><p></p>
Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she "wished they might be happy." Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:<p></p><p></p>
"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."<p></p><p></p>
"That you certainly shall."<p></p><p></p>
"And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?"<p></p><p></p>
"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."<p></p><p></p>
"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit.<p></p><p></p>
"My father and Maria are coming to me in March," added Charlotte, "and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them."<p></p><p></p>
The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte's first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine's behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins's picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest.<p></p><p></p>
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.<p></p><p></p>
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost.<p></p><p></p>
"My aunt," she continued, "is going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street."<p></p><p></p>
She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley. "I did not think Caroline in spirits," were her words, "but she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall see them soon here."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister's being in town.<p></p><p></p>
Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt.<p></p><p></p>
"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out as she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now, because, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago. He knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of what will make me happy—your affection, and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.—Yours, etc."<p></p><p></p>
This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy's sister, as by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte's, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy.<p></p><p></p>
All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: "I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards him; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain."<p></p><p></p>

With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> to Hunsford. <span class="transformed">He</span> had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> soon found, was depending on the plan and <span class="transformed">he</span> gradually learned to consider it <span class="transformed">himself</span> with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> desire of seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> again, and weakened <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> disgust of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a <span class="transformed">father</span> and such uncompanionable <span class="transformed">brothers</span>, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> a peep at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>; and, in short, as the time drew near, <span class="transformed">he</span> would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>'s first sketch. <span class="transformed">He</span> was to accompany <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> second <span class="transformed">son</span>. The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.<p></p><p></p>
The only pain was in leaving <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, who would certainly <span class="transformed">mr</span> <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> going, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> told <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to write to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and almost promised to answer <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> letter.<p></p><p></p>
The farewell between <span class="transformed">himself</span> and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> side even more. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> present pursuit could not make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> forget that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had been the first to excite and to deserve <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> manner of bidding <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> adieu, wishing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> every enjoyment, reminding <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> of what <span class="transformed">he</span> was to expect in <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>—their opinion of everybody—would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which <span class="transformed">he</span> felt must ever attach <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> with a most sincere regard; and <span class="transformed">he</span> parted from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> convinced that, whether married or single, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must always be <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> model of the amiable and pleasing.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> think <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> less agreeable. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> Lucas, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">son</span> Maria, a good-humoured <span class="transformed">boy</span>, but as empty-headed as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> loved absurdities, but <span class="transformed">he</span> had known <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span>'s too long. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> could tell <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> nothing new of the wonders of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> presentation and knighthood; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> civilities were worn out, like <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> information.<p></p><p></p>
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner's door, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage <span class="transformed">he</span> was there to welcome them, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, looking earnestly in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">girls</span></span> and <span class="transformed">boys</span>, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> then contrived to sit by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span>. Their first object was <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>; and <span class="transformed">he</span> was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> minute inquiries, that though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> always struggled to support <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner gave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> the particulars also of <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> and <span class="transformed">himself</span>, which proved that the former had, from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> heart, given up the acquaintance.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner then rallied <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">nephew</span> on Wickham's desertion, and complimented <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> on bearing it so well.<p></p><p></p>
"But my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>," <span class="transformed">he</span> added, "what sort of <span class="transformed">boy</span> is <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Mr King</span></span>? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."<p></p><p></p>
"Pray, my dear <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is trying to get a <span class="transformed">boy</span> with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is mercenary."<p></p><p></p>
"If you will only tell me what sort of <span class="transformed">boy</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Mr King</span></span> is, I shall know what to think."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">He</span> is a very good kind of <span class="transformed">boy</span>, I believe. I know no harm of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> paid <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> not the smallest attention till <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">grandmother</span></span>'s death made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">master</span> of this fortune."<p></p><p></p>
"No—why should <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>? If it were not allowable for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to gain my affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a <span class="transformed">boy</span> whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did not care about, and who was equally poor?"<p></p><p></p>
"But there seems an indelicacy in directing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attentions towards <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> so soon after this event."<p></p><p></p>
"A <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe. If <span class="transformed">he</span> does not object to it, why should we?"<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> not objecting does not justify <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. It only shows <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> being deficient in something <span class="transformed">himself</span>—sense or feeling."<p></p><p></p>
"Well," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "have it as you choose. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> shall be mercenary, and <span class="transformed">he</span> shall be foolish."<p></p><p></p>
"No, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, that is what I do not choose. I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> who has lived so long in Derbyshire."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span> who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> who has not one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to recommend <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. Stupid <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span> are the only ones worth knowing, after all."<p></p><p></p>
"Take care, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."<p></p><p></p>
Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, <span class="transformed">he</span> had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span> in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.<p></p><p></p>
"We have not determined how far it shall carry us," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, "but, perhaps, to the Lakes."<p></p><p></p>
No scheme could have been more agreeable to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. "Oh, my dear, dear <span class="transformed">uncle</span>," <span class="transformed">he</span> rapturously cried, "what delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span> to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We will know where we have gone—we will recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers."<p></p><p></p>

With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.<p></p><p></p>
The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.<p></p><p></p>
The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her—their opinion of everybody—would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.<p></p><p></p>
Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out, like his information.<p></p><p></p>
It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever.

"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her."<p></p><p></p>
"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune."<p></p><p></p>
"No—why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?"<p></p><p></p>
"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event."<p></p><p></p>

"Well," cried Elizabeth, "have it as you choose. He shall be mercenary, and she shall be foolish."<p></p><p></p>
"No, Lizzy, that is what I do not choose. I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven!

Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for <span class="transformed">he</span> had seen <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> looking so well as to banish all fear for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> health, and the prospect of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> northern tour was a constant source of delight.<p></p><p></p>
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> smiled at the recollection of all that <span class="transformed">he</span> had heard of its inhabitants.<p></p><p></p>
At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins welcomed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend with the liveliest pleasure, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was more and more satisfied with coming when <span class="transformed">he</span> found <span class="transformed">himself</span> so affectionately received. <span class="transformed">He</span> saw instantly that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> cousin's manners were not altered by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> marriage; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> formal civility was just what it had been, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> detained <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> inquiries after all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family. They were then, with no other delay than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious formality to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> humble abode, and punctually repeated all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>'s offers of refreshment.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was prepared to see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> glory; and <span class="transformed">he</span> could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> addressed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> particularly to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, as if wishing to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feel what <span class="transformed">he</span> had lost in refusing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, <span class="transformed">he</span> was not able to gratify <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend that <span class="transformed">he</span> could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins said anything of which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span> might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, <span class="transformed">he</span> involuntarily turned <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eye on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>. Once or twice <span class="transformed">he</span> could discern a faint blush; but in general <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in London, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> attended <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>. To work in this garden was one of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> most respectable pleasures; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> admired the command of countenance with which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned <span class="transformed">he</span> encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> garden, or which the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> house. It was a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> modern building, well situated on rising ground.<p></p><p></p>
From <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> garden, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins would have led them round <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> two meadows; but the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span>, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> accompanied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> took <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>'s help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> gave <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> all the credit. When <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>'s evident enjoyment of it, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> supposed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must be often forgotten.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> had already learnt that <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> was still in the country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins joining in, observed:<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, you will have the honour of seeing <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying <span class="transformed">he</span> will include you and my <span class="transformed">brother</span> Maria in every invitation with which <span class="transformed">he</span> honours us during your stay here. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> behaviour to my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should say, one of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship's carriages, for <span class="transformed">he</span> has several."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> is a very respectable, sensible <span class="transformed">man</span> indeed," added <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>, "and a most attentive neighbour."<p></p><p></p>
"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. <span class="transformed">He</span> is the sort of <span class="transformed">man</span> whom one cannot regard with too much deference."<p></p><p></p>
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, in the solitude of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> chamber, had to meditate upon <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>'s degree of contentment, to understand <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. <span class="transformed">He</span> had also to anticipate how <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.<p></p><p></p>
About the middle of the next day, as <span class="transformed">he</span> was in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, <span class="transformed">he</span> heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> opened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out—<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> asked questions in vain; Maria would tell <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.<p></p><p></p>
"And is this all?" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>. "I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"La! my dear," said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>. The old <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> is <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh. Only look at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> is quite a little creature. Who would have thought that <span class="transformed">he</span> could be so thin and small?"<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">He</span> is abominably rude to keep <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> out of doors in all this wind. Why does <span class="transformed">he</span> not come in?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> says <span class="transformed">he</span> hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh comes in."<p></p><p></p>
"I like <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> appearance," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, struck with other ideas. "<span class="transformed">He</span> looks sickly and cross. Yes, <span class="transformed">he</span> will do for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> very well. <span class="transformed">He</span> will make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> a very proper <span class="transformed">husband</span>."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> were both standing at the gate in conversation with the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span>; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span>, to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and constantly bowing whenever <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh looked that way.<p></p><p></p>
At length there was nothing more to be said; the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> drove on, and the others returned into the house. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins no sooner saw the two <span class="transformed">boys</span> than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.<p></p><p></p>
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.<p></p><p></p>
At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.<p></p><p></p>
From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband's help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte's evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten.<p></p><p></p>
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed:<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I should say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."<p></p><p></p>
"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed," added Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."<p></p><p></p>
"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."<p></p><p></p>
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.<p></p><p></p>
About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened the door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out—<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate.<p></p><p></p>
"And is this all?" cried Elizabeth. "I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter."<p></p><p></p>
"La! my dear," said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, "it is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?"<p></p><p></p>
"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in."<p></p><p></p>
"I like her appearance," said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. "She looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.<p></p><p></p>
At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> patroness to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> wondering visitors, and of letting them see <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> civility towards <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>, was exactly what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>'s condescension, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> knew not how to admire enough.<p></p><p></p>
"I confess," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "that I should not have been at all surprised by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> affability, that it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!"<p></p><p></p>
"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span>, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."<p></p><p></p>
Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.<p></p><p></p>
When the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> were separating for the toilette, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> said to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>—<p></p><p></p>
"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes <span class="transformed">himself</span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest—there is no occasion for anything more. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. <span class="transformed">He</span> likes to have the distinction of rank preserved."<p></p><p></p>
While they were dressing, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> very much objected to be kept waiting for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> dinner. Such formidable accounts of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to company, and <span class="transformed">he</span> looked forward to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> had done to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> presentation at St. James's.<p></p><p></p>
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> saw much to be pleased with, though <span class="transformed">he</span> could not be in such raptures as <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Madam</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliza</span></span> de Bourgh.<p></p><p></p>
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> did not look perfectly calm. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s courage did not fail <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> had heard nothing of <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> that spoke <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank <span class="transformed">he</span> thought <span class="transformed">he</span> could witness without trepidation.<p></p><p></p>
From the entrance-hall, of which <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>, and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Jenkinson were sitting. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins had settled it with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would have thought necessary.<p></p><p></p>
In spite of having been at St. James's, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> seat without saying a word; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">son</span>, frightened almost out of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> senses, sat on the edge of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> chair, not knowing which way to look. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> found <span class="transformed">himself</span> quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> before <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> composedly. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> was a tall, large <span class="transformed">man</span>, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> air was not conciliating, nor was <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> manner of receiving them such as to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> visitors forget their inferior rank. <span class="transformed">He</span> was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever <span class="transformed">he</span> said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> self-importance, and brought <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham immediately to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, <span class="transformed">he</span> believed <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> to be exactly what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> represented.<p></p><p></p>
When, after examining the <span class="transformed">father</span>, in whose countenance and deportment <span class="transformed">he</span> soon found some resemblance of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, <span class="transformed">he</span> turned <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes on the <span class="transformed">son</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span>. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh was pale and sickly; <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> features, though not plain, were insignificant; and <span class="transformed">he</span> spoke very little, except in a low voice, to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what <span class="transformed">he</span> said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes.<p></p><p></p>
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.<p></p><p></p>
The dinner was exceedingly <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins had promised; and, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had likewise foretold, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> took <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> seat at the bottom of the table, by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship's desire, and looked as if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> felt that life could furnish nothing greater. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> and then by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span>, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span>-in-law said, in a manner which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> wondered <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> could bear. But <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but <span class="transformed">he</span> was seated between <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, and the latter said not a word to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> all dinner-time. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh ate, pressing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to try some other dish, and fearing <span class="transformed">he</span> was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> did nothing but eat and admire.<p></p><p></p>
When the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> talk, which <span class="transformed">he</span> did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that <span class="transformed">he</span> was not used to have <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> judgement controverted. <span class="transformed">He</span> inquired into <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>'s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> as to the care of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> cows and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> poultry. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> found that nothing was beneath this great <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>'s attention, which could furnish <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with an occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> discourse with <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins, <span class="transformed">he</span> addressed a variety of questions to Maria and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, but especially to the latter, of whose connections <span class="transformed">he</span> knew the least, and who <span class="transformed">he</span> observed to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins was a very genteel, pretty kind of <span class="transformed">boy</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> asked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, at different times, how many <span class="transformed">brothers</span> <span class="transformed">he</span> had, whether they were older or younger than <span class="transformed">himself</span>, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>, where they had been educated, what carriage <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> kept, and what had been <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>'s maiden name? <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> felt all the impertinence of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> questions but answered them very composedly. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> then observed,<p></p><p></p>
"Your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s estate is entailed on <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, I think. For your sake," turning to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the <span class="transformed">male</span> line. It was not thought necessary in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Madam</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliza</span></span> de Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet?"<p></p><p></p>
"A little."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to——You shall try it some day. Do your <span class="transformed">brothers</span> play and sing?"<p></p><p></p>
"One of them does."<p></p><p></p>
"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Webbs all play, and their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> has not so good an income as yours. Do you draw?"<p></p><p></p>
"No, not at all."<p></p><p></p>
"What, none of you?"<p></p><p></p>
"Not one."<p></p><p></p>
"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your <span class="transformed">father</span> should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistresses</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"My <span class="transformed">father</span> would have had no objection, but my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> hates London."<p></p><p></p>
"Has your governess left you?"<p></p><p></p>
"We never had any governess."<p></p><p></p>
"No governess! How was that possible? Five <span class="transformed">sons</span> brought up at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your <span class="transformed">father</span> must have been quite a slave to your education."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could hardly help smiling as <span class="transformed">he</span> assured <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that had not been the case.<p></p><p></p>
"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must have been neglected."<p></p><p></p>
"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistresses</span></span> that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might."<p></p><p></p>
"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your <span class="transformed">father</span>, I should have advised <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four <span class="transformed">nephews</span> of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins, did I tell you of <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> Metcalf's calling yesterday to thank me? <span class="transformed">He</span> finds <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Pope a treasure. '<span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>,' said <span class="transformed">he</span>, 'you have given me a treasure.' Are any of your younger <span class="transformed">brothers</span> out, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, ma'am, all."<p></p><p></p>
"All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger <span class="transformed">brothers</span> must be very young?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps <span class="transformed">he</span> is full young to be much in company. But really, ma'am, I think it would be very hard upon younger <span class="transformed">brothers</span>, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back on such a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind."<p></p><p></p>
"Upon my word," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship, "you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?"<p></p><p></p>
"With three younger <span class="transformed">brothers</span> grown up," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, smiling, "your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> suspected <span class="transformed">himself</span> to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.<p></p><p></p>
"You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age."<p></p><p></p>
"I am not one-and-twenty."<p></p><p></p>
When the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were placed. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span>, and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two <span class="transformed">boys</span> had the honour of assisting <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Jenkinson to make up <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Jenkinson expressed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> fears of <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the other table. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> was generally speaking—stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of <span class="transformed">himself</span>. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship said, thanking <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for every fish <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> won, and apologising if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> thought <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> won too many. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> did not say much. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was storing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> memory with anecdotes and noble names.<p></p><p></p>
When <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span> had played as long as they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to hear <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's side and as many bows on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span>'s they departed. As soon as they had driven from the door, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was called on by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> cousin to give <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> opinion of all that <span class="transformed">he</span> had seen at Rosings, which, for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>'s sake, <span class="transformed">he</span> made more favourable than it really was. But <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> commendation, though costing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> some trouble, could by no means satisfy <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was very soon obliged to take <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship's praise into <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own hands.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Collins's triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.<p></p><p></p>
"I confess," said he, "that I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship's asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it would happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!"<p></p><p></p>
"I am the less surprised at what has happened," replied Sir William, "from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon."<p></p><p></p>
Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.<p></p><p></p>
When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth—<p></p><p></p>
"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest—there is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved."<p></p><p></p>
While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of her ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St. James's.<p></p><p></p>
As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.<p></p><p></p>
When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria's alarm was every moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm. Elizabeth's courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation.<p></p><p></p>
From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady Catherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.<p></p><p></p>
In spite of having been at St. James's, Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word; and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone, as marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth's mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.<p></p><p></p>
When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria's astonishment at her being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes.<p></p><p></p>
After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.<p></p><p></p>
The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship's desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.<p></p><p></p>
When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte's domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew the least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel, pretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,<p></p><p></p>
"Your father's estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake," turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family. Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?"<p></p><p></p>
"A little."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to——You shall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?"<p></p><p></p>
"One of them does."<p></p><p></p>
"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do you draw?"<p></p><p></p>
"No, not at all."<p></p><p></p>
"What, none of you?"<p></p><p></p>
"Not one."<p></p><p></p>
"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters."<p></p><p></p>
"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London."<p></p><p></p>
"Has your governess left you?"<p></p><p></p>
"We never had any governess."<p></p><p></p>
"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case.<p></p><p></p>
"Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must have been neglected."<p></p><p></p>
"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be idle, certainly might."<p></p><p></p>

"I am not one-and-twenty."<p></p><p></p>
When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh's being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.

<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> stayed only a week at Hunsford, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> visit was long enough to convince <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">son</span>'s being most comfortably settled, and of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> possessing such a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> and such a neighbour as were not often met with. While <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> was with them, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins devoted <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> morning to driving <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> out in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> gig, and showing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> the country; but when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was thankful to find that they did not see more of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in which the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> sat was backwards. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had at first rather wondered that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect; but <span class="transformed">he</span> soon saw that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend had an excellent reason for what <span class="transformed">he</span> did, for <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and <span class="transformed">he</span> gave <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> credit for the arrangement.<p></p><p></p>
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh drove by in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> phaeton, which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. <span class="transformed">He</span> not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out.<p></p><p></p>
Very few days passed in which <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span> did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship, and nothing escaped <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> observation that was passing in the room during these visits. <span class="transformed">He</span> examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if <span class="transformed">he</span> accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins's joints of meat were too large for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> soon perceived, that though this great <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> was not in commission of the peace of the county, <span class="transformed">he</span> was a most active magistrate in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> by <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, <span class="transformed">he</span> sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.<p></p><p></p>
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span>, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's reach. This, however, was no evil to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, and upon the whole <span class="transformed">he</span> spent <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> time comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that <span class="transformed">he</span> had often great enjoyment out of doors. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> favourite walk, and where <span class="transformed">he</span> frequently went while the others were calling on <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but <span class="transformed">himself</span>, and where <span class="transformed">he</span> felt beyond the reach of <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>'s curiosity.<p></p><p></p>
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> visit soon passed away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had heard soon after <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> arrival that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> acquaintances whom <span class="transformed">he</span> did not prefer, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and <span class="transformed">he</span> might be amused in seeing how hopeless <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley's designs on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> were, by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> behaviour to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousin, for whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was evidently destined by <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, who talked of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had already been frequently seen by <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas and <span class="transformed">himself</span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following morning <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> hastened to Rosings to pay <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> respects. There were two <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">nieces</span></span> of <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> to require them, for <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy had brought with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> a Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>, the younger <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span> of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> Lord ——, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins returned, the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> accompanied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> had seen them from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>'s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the <span class="transformed">boys</span> what an honour they might expect, adding:<p></p><p></p>
"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> entered the room. Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>, who led the way, was about thirty, not <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>, but in person and address most truly the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy looked just as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been used to look in Hertfordshire—paid <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> compliments, with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> usual reserve, to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins, and whatever might be <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> feelings toward <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend, met <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with every appearance of composure. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> merely curtseyed to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> without saying a word.<p></p><p></p>
Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span> entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, and talked very pleasantly; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> civility was so far awakened as to inquire of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> after the health of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family. <span class="transformed">He</span> answered <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added:<p></p><p></p>
"My eldest <span class="transformed">brother</span> has been in town these three months. Have you never happened to see <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> there?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> was perfectly sensible that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> never had; but <span class="transformed">he</span> wished to see whether <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, and <span class="transformed">he</span> thought <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> looked a little confused as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> answered that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had never been so fortunate as to meet <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> soon afterwards went away.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter's being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.<p></p><p></p>
From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out.<p></p><p></p>
Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.<p></p><p></p>
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins's reach. This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.<p></p><p></p>
In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.<p></p><p></p>
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord ——, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:<p></p><p></p>
"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire—paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.<p></p><p></p>
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added:<p></p><p></p>
"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never happened to see her there?"<p></p><p></p>
She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>'s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> all felt that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither—for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span>'s arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little of <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> or <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>. Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span> had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy they had seen only at church.<p></p><p></p>
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>'s drawing-room. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when <span class="transformed">he</span> could get nobody else; and <span class="transformed">he</span> was, in fact, almost engrossed by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">nieces</span></span>, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.<p></p><p></p>
Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span> seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at Rosings; and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> fancy very much. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> now seated <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> <span class="transformed">himself</span>, as well as of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship, after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for <span class="transformed">he</span> did not scruple to call out:<p></p><p></p>
"What is that you are saying, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet? Let me hear what it is."<p></p><p></p>
"We are speaking of music, <span class="transformed">sir</span>," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, when no longer able to avoid a reply.<p></p><p></p>
"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Aubrey</span></span>, if <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> health had allowed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to apply. I am confident that <span class="transformed">he</span> would have performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s proficiency.<p></p><p></p>
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>," said <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>; "and pray tell <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> from me, that <span class="transformed">he</span> cannot expect to excel if <span class="transformed">he</span> does not practice a good deal."<p></p><p></p>
"I assure you, <span class="transformed">sir</span>," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> replied, "that <span class="transformed">he</span> does not need such advice. <span class="transformed">He</span> practises very constantly."<p></p><p></p>
"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, I shall charge <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> not to neglect it on any account. I often tell young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice. I have told <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet several times, that <span class="transformed">he</span> will never play really well unless <span class="transformed">he</span> practises more; and though <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins has no instrument, <span class="transformed">he</span> is very welcome, as I have often told <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Jenkinson's room. <span class="transformed">He</span> would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy looked a little ashamed of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span>'s ill-breeding, and made no answer.<p></p><p></p>
When coffee was over, Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span> reminded <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> of having promised to play to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; and <span class="transformed">he</span> sat down directly to the instrument. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> drew a chair near <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> other <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span>; till the latter walked away from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and making with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> saw what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> with an arch smile, and said:<p></p><p></p>
"You mean to frighten me, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your <span class="transformed">brother</span> does play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me."<p></p><p></p>
"I shall not say you are mistaken," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> laughed heartily at this picture of <span class="transformed">himself</span>, and said to Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too—for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear."<p></p><p></p>
"I am not afraid of you," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, smilingly.<p></p><p></p>
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> of," cried Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>. "I should like to know how <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> behaves among strangers."<p></p><p></p>
"You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what do you think <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did? <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> danced only four dances, though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> was sitting down in want of a partner. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."<p></p><p></p>
"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> in the assembly beyond my own party."<p></p><p></p>
"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders."<p></p><p></p>
"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers."<p></p><p></p>
"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, still addressing Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>. "Shall we ask <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> why a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> to strangers?"<p></p><p></p>
"I can answer your question," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>, "without applying to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. It is because <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will not give <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> the trouble."<p></p><p></p>
"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done."<p></p><p></p>
"My fingers," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many <span class="transformed">men</span>'s do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault—because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other <span class="transformed">man</span>'s of superior execution."<p></p><p></p>
Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers."<p></p><p></p>
Here they were interrupted by <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, who called out to know what they were talking of. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> immediately began playing again. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy:<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet would not play at all amiss if <span class="transformed">he</span> practised more, and could have the advantage of a London <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> has a very good notion of fingering, though <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> taste is not equal to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Aubrey</span></span>'s. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Aubrey</span></span> would have been a delightful performer, had <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> health allowed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to learn."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> looked at Darcy to see how cordially <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> assented to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could <span class="transformed">he</span> discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> behaviour to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh <span class="transformed">he</span> derived this comfort for <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might have been just as likely to marry <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, had <span class="transformed">he</span> been <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> relation.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> continued <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> remarks on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> received them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span>, remained at the instrument till <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither—for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen's arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen only at church.<p></p><p></p>
The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine's drawing-room. Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room.<p></p><p></p>
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy. His eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out:<p></p><p></p>
"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is."<p></p><p></p>
"We are speaking of music, madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.<p></p><p></p>
"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?"<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.<p></p><p></p>
"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal."<p></p><p></p>
"I assure you, madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice. She practises very constantly."<p></p><p></p>
"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part of the house."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and made no answer.<p></p><p></p>
When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:<p></p><p></p>
"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me."<p></p><p></p>
"I shall not say you are mistaken," he replied, "because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too—for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear."<p></p><p></p>
"I am not afraid of you," said he, smilingly.<p></p><p></p>
"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of," cried Colonel Fitzwilliam. "I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."<p></p><p></p>
"You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."<p></p><p></p>
"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party."<p></p><p></p>
"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders."<p></p><p></p>
"Perhaps," said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers."<p></p><p></p>
"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?" said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. "Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"<p></p><p></p>
"I can answer your question," said Fitzwilliam, "without applying to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble."<p></p><p></p>
"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess," said Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done."<p></p><p></p>
"My fingers," said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault—because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman's of superior execution."<p></p><p></p>
Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers."<p></p><p></p>
Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy:<p></p><p></p>
"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry her, had she been his relation.<p></p><p></p>
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship's carriage was ready to take them all home.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was sitting by <span class="transformed">himself</span> the next morning, and writing to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> while <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when <span class="transformed">he</span> was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor. As <span class="transformed">he</span> had heard no carriage, <span class="transformed">he</span> thought it not unlikely to be <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, and under that apprehension was putting away <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> half-finished letter that <span class="transformed">he</span> might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> very great surprise, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy only, entered the room.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> seemed astonished too on finding <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> alone, and apologised for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> intrusion by letting <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> know that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had understood all the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> were to be within.<p></p><p></p>
They then sat down, and when <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting when <span class="transformed">he</span> had seen <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would say on the subject of their hasty departure, <span class="transformed">he</span> observed:<p></p><p></p>
"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley to see you all after <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> so soon; for, if I recollect right, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> went but the day before. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> were well, I hope, when you left London?"<p></p><p></p>
"Perfectly so, I thank you."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> found that <span class="transformed">he</span> was to receive no other answer, and, after a short pause added:<p></p><p></p>
"I think I have understood that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?"<p></p><p></p>
"I have never heard <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> say so; but it is probable that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> may spend very little of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> time there in the future. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> has many friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing."<p></p><p></p>
"If <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own, and we must expect <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to keep it or quit it on the same principle."<p></p><p></p>
"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> made no answer. <span class="transformed">He</span> was afraid of talking longer of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable house. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, I believe, did a great deal to it when <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins first came to Hunsford."<p></p><p></p>
"I believe <span class="transformed">he</span> did—and I am sure <span class="transformed">he</span> could not have bestowed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> kindness on a more grateful object."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins appears to be very fortunate in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> choice of a <span class="transformed">husband</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, indeed, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friends may well rejoice in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> having met with one of the very few sensible <span class="transformed">men</span> who would have accepted <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, or have made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding—though I am not certain that I consider <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> marrying <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins as the wisest thing <span class="transformed">he</span> ever did. <span class="transformed">He</span> seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"It must be very agreeable for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to be settled within so easy a distance of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own family and friends."<p></p><p></p>
"An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles."<p></p><p></p>
"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance."<p></p><p></p>
"I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>. "I should never have said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins was settled near <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family."<p></p><p></p>
"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."<p></p><p></p>
As <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> spoke there was a sort of smile which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> fancied <span class="transformed">he</span> understood; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must be supposing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to be thinking of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> and Netherfield, and <span class="transformed">he</span> blushed as <span class="transformed">he</span> answered:<p></p><p></p>
"I do not mean to say that a <span class="transformed">man</span> may not be settled too near <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case here. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys—and I am persuaded my friend would not call <span class="transformed">himself</span> near <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family under less than half the present distance."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy drew <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> chair a little towards <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and said, "You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. You cannot have been always at Longbourn."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> looked surprised. The <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> experienced some change of feeling; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> drew back <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:<p></p><p></p>
"Are you pleased with Kent?"<p></p><p></p>
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise—and soon put an end to by the entrance of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, just returned from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> walk. The tete-a-tete surprised them. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> intruding on <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.<p></p><p></p>
"What can be the meaning of this?" said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>, as soon as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was gone. "My dear, Eliza, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must be in love with you, or <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would never have called us in this familiar way."<p></p><p></p>
But when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> told of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> silence, it did not seem very likely, even to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>'s wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, books, and a billiard-table, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their <span class="transformed">uncle</span>. It was plain to them all that Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span> came because <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> still more; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was reminded by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own satisfaction in being with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, as well as by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> evident admiration of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> former favourite <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Georgiana</span></span> Wickham; and though, in comparing them, <span class="transformed">he</span> saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>'s manners, <span class="transformed">he</span> believed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might have the best informed mind.<p></p><p></p>
But why <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> lips; and when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice—a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> seldom appeared really animated. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins knew not what to make of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>'s occasionally laughing at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> stupidity, proved that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was generally different, which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own knowledge of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> could not have told <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; and as <span class="transformed">he</span> would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of that love <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend Eliza, <span class="transformed">he</span> set <span class="transformed">himself</span> seriously to work to find it out. <span class="transformed">He</span> watched <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> came to Hunsford; but without much success. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> certainly looked at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but <span class="transformed">he</span> often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> had once or twice suggested to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> the possibility of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> being partial to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> always laughed at the idea; and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend's dislike would vanish, if <span class="transformed">he</span> could suppose <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to be in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> power.<p></p><p></p>
In <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> kind schemes for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> sometimes planned <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> marrying Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was beyond comparison the most pleasant <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> certainly admired <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousin could have none at all.<p></p><p></p>

Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.<p></p><p></p>

"I should not be surprised," said Darcy, "if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him.<p></p><p></p>
He took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford."<p></p><p></p>
"I believe she did—and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object."<p></p><p></p>
"Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding—though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her."<p></p><p></p>
"It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends."<p></p><p></p>
"An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles."<p></p><p></p>
"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance."<p></p><p></p>
"I should never have considered the distance as one of the advantages of the match," cried Elizabeth. "I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled near her family."<p></p><p></p>
"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far."<p></p><p></p>
As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered:<p></p><p></p>
"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case here. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys—and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, "You cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. You cannot have been always at Longbourn."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:<p></p><p></p>
"Are you pleased with Kent?"<p></p><p></p>
A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise—and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.<p></p><p></p>
"What can be the meaning of this?" said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone. "My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called us in this familiar way."<p></p><p></p>
But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.<p></p><p></p>
But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice—a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind.<p></p><p></p>
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.<p></p><p></p>
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his cousin could have none at all.<p></p><p></p>

More than once did <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy. <span class="transformed">He</span> felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> where no one else was brought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> never said a great deal, nor did <span class="transformed">he</span> give <span class="transformed">himself</span> the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in the course of their third rencontre that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was asking some odd unconnected questions—about <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> pleasure in being at Hunsford, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> love of solitary walks, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> opinion of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> not perfectly understanding the house, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> seemed to expect that whenever <span class="transformed">he</span> came into Kent again <span class="transformed">he</span> would be staying there too. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> words seemed to imply it. Could <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> have Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span> in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> thoughts? <span class="transformed">He</span> supposed, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> meant anything, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> a little, and <span class="transformed">he</span> was quite glad to find <span class="transformed">himself</span> at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> was engaged one day as <span class="transformed">he</span> walked, in perusing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, <span class="transformed">he</span> saw on looking up that Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span> was meeting <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, <span class="transformed">he</span> said:<p></p><p></p>
"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."<p></p><p></p>
"I have been making the tour of the park," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> replied, "as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?"<p></p><p></p>
"No, I should have turned in a moment."<p></p><p></p>
And accordingly <span class="transformed">he</span> did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.<p></p><p></p>
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said <span class="transformed">he</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> disposal. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> arranges the business just as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> pleases."<p></p><p></p>
"And if not able to please <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> in the arrangement, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has at least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> likes than <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> likes to have <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own way very well," replied Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>. "But so we all do. It is only that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has better means of having it than many others, because <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span>, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence."<p></p><p></p>
"In my opinion, the younger <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span> of an <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">countess</span></span> can know very little of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?"<p></p><p></p>
"These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughters</span></span> cannot marry where they like."<p></p><p></p>
"Unless where they like <span class="transformed">men</span> of fortune, which I think they very often do."<p></p><p></p>
"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money."<p></p><p></p>
"Is this," thought <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "meant for me?" and <span class="transformed">he</span> coloured at the idea; but, recovering <span class="transformed">himself</span>, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">countess</span></span>'s younger <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span>? Unless the elder <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> answered <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> fancy <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> affected with what had passed, <span class="transformed">he</span> soon afterwards said:<p></p><p></p>
"I imagine your cousin brought you down with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> chiefly for the sake of having someone at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> disposal. I wonder <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> does as well for the present, and, as <span class="transformed">he</span> is under <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> sole care, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> may do what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> likes with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"No," said Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>, "that is an advantage which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must divide with me. I am joined with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in the guardianship of <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy."<p></p><p></p>
"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if <span class="transformed">he</span> has the true Darcy spirit, <span class="transformed">he</span> may like to have <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own way."<p></p><p></p>
As <span class="transformed">he</span> spoke <span class="transformed">he</span> observed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> looking at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> earnestly; and the manner in which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> immediately asked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> why <span class="transformed">he</span> supposed <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that <span class="transformed">he</span> had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. <span class="transformed">He</span> directly replied:<p></p><p></p>
"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; and I dare say <span class="transformed">he</span> is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. <span class="transformed">He</span> is a very great favourite with some <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> of my acquaintance, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them."<p></p><p></p>
"I know them a little. Their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> is a pleasant <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladylike</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>—<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is a great friend of Darcy's."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! yes," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> drily; "<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy is uncommonly kind to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Care of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>! Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in those points where <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> most wants care. From something that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. But I ought to beg <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture."<p></p><p></p>
"What is it you mean?"<p></p><p></p>
"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>'s family, it would be an unpleasant thing."<p></p><p></p>
"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."<p></p><p></p>
"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley. What <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> told me was merely this: that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> congratulated <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> the kind of young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."<p></p><p></p>
"Did <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?"<p></p><p></p>
"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"And what arts did <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> use to separate them?"<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> did not talk to me of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own arts," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>, smiling. "<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> only told me what I have now told you."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> made no answer, and walked on, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> heart swelling with indignation. After watching <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> a little, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span> asked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> why <span class="transformed">he</span> was so thoughtful.<p></p><p></p>
"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said <span class="transformed">he</span>. "Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> to be the judge?"<p></p><p></p>
"You are rather disposed to call <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> interference officious?"<p></p><p></p>
"I do not see what right <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend's inclination, or why, upon <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own judgement alone, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was to determine and direct in what manner <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend was to be happy. But," <span class="transformed">he</span> continued, recollecting <span class="transformed">himself</span>, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case."<p></p><p></p>
"That is not an unnatural surmise," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>, "but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."<p></p><p></p>
This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> so just a picture of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, that <span class="transformed">he</span> would not trust <span class="transformed">himself</span> with an answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own room, as soon as their visitor left them, <span class="transformed">he</span> could think without interruption of all that <span class="transformed">he</span> had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom <span class="transformed">he</span> was connected. There could not exist in the world two <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span> over whom <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy could have such boundless influence. That <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> <span class="transformed">he</span> had never doubted; but <span class="transformed">he</span> had always attributed to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own vanity, however, did not mislead <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was the cause, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> pride and caprice were the cause, of all that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had suffered, and still continued to suffer. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might have inflicted.<p></p><p></p>
"There were some very strong objections against the <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>," were Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>'s words; and those strong objections probably were, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> having one <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.<p></p><p></p>
"To <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> <span class="transformed">himself</span>," <span class="transformed">he</span> exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection; all loveliness and goodness as <span class="transformed">he</span> is!—<span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> understanding excellent, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> mind improved, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> manners captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> need not disdain, and respectability which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will probably never reach." When <span class="transformed">he</span> thought of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> confidence gave way a little; but <span class="transformed">he</span> would not allow that any objections there had material weight with <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, whose pride, <span class="transformed">he</span> was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and <span class="transformed">he</span> was quite decided, at last, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>.<p></p><p></p>
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> unwillingness to see <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, it determined <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> not to attend <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins, seeing that <span class="transformed">he</span> was really unwell, did not press <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to go and as much as possible prevented <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> from pressing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; but <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins could not conceal <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> apprehension of <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>'s being rather displeased by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> staying at home.<p></p><p></p>

More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park, unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions—about her pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying there too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage.<p></p><p></p>
She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane's last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:<p></p><p></p>
"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."<p></p><p></p>
"I have been making the tour of the park," he replied, "as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?"<p></p><p></p>
"No, I should have turned in a moment."<p></p><p></p>
And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.<p></p><p></p>
"Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she.<p></p><p></p>
"Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases."<p></p><p></p>
"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy."<p></p><p></p>
"He likes to have his own way very well," replied Colonel Fitzwilliam. "But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence."<p></p><p></p>
"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?"<p></p><p></p>
"These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like."<p></p><p></p>
"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do."<p></p><p></p>
"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money."<p></p><p></p>
"Is this," thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?" and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, "And pray, what is the usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds."<p></p><p></p>
He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said:<p></p><p></p>
"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her."<p></p><p></p>
"No," said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."<p></p><p></p>
"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way."<p></p><p></p>
As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly replied:<p></p><p></p>
"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them."<p></p><p></p>
"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man—he is a great friend of Darcy's."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! yes," said Elizabeth drily; "Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."<p></p><p></p>
"Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture."<p></p><p></p>
"What is it you mean?"<p></p><p></p>
"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing."<p></p><p></p>
"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."<p></p><p></p>
"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."<p></p><p></p>
"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?"<p></p><p></p>
"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady."<p></p><p></p>
"And what arts did he use to separate them?"<p></p><p></p>
"He did not talk to me of his own arts," said Fitzwilliam, smiling. "He only told me what I have now told you."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful.<p></p><p></p>
"I am thinking of what you have been telling me," said she. "Your cousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?"<p></p><p></p>
"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"<p></p><p></p>
"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy. But," she continued, recollecting herself, "as we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case."<p></p><p></p>
"That is not an unnatural surmise," said Fitzwilliam, "but it is a lessening of the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."<p></p><p></p>
This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the world two men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, he was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.<p></p><p></p>
"There were some very strong objections against the lady," were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words; and those strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.<p></p><p></p>
"To Jane herself," she exclaimed, "there could be no possibility of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!—her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach." When she thought of her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.<p></p><p></p>
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine's being rather displeased by her staying at home.<p></p><p></p>

When they were gone, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, as if intending to exasperate <span class="transformed">himself</span> as much as possible against <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, chose for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> employment the examination of all the letters which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had written to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> since <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's shameful boast of what misery <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been able to inflict, gave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> a keener sense of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s sufferings. It was some consolation to think that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next—and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight <span class="transformed">he</span> should <span class="transformed">himself</span> be with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> spirits, by all that affection could do.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousin was to go with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; but Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span> had made it clear that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had no intentions at all, and agreeable as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was, <span class="transformed">he</span> did not mean to be unhappy about <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
While settling this point, <span class="transformed">he</span> was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. But this idea was soon banished, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> spirits were very differently affected, when, to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> utter amazement, <span class="transformed">he</span> saw <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried manner <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> immediately began an inquiry after <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> health, imputing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> visit to a wish of hearing that <span class="transformed">he</span> were better. <span class="transformed">He</span> answered <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> with cold civility. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> came towards <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in an agitated manner, and thus began:<p></p><p></p>
"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s astonishment was beyond expression. <span class="transformed">He</span> stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> considered sufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> felt, and had long felt for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, immediately followed. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> sense of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> inferiority—of its being a degradation—of the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> suit.<p></p><p></p>
In spite of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> deeply-rooted dislike, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not be insensible to the compliment of such a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>'s affection, and though <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> intentions did not vary for an instant, <span class="transformed">he</span> was at first sorry for the pain <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was to receive; till, roused to resentment by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> subsequent language, <span class="transformed">he</span> lost all compassion in anger. <span class="transformed">He</span> tried, however, to compose <span class="transformed">himself</span> to answer <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> with patience, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should have done. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> concluded with representing to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> endeavours, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> hope that it would now be rewarded by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> acceptance of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> hand. As <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> said this, <span class="transformed">he</span> could easily see that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had no doubt of a favourable answer. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> ceased, the colour rose into <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> cheeks, and <span class="transformed">he</span> said:<p></p><p></p>
"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could feel gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot—I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> eyes fixed on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> face, seemed to catch <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> words with no less resentment than surprise. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> mind was visible in every feature. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> lips till <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> believed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> to have attained it. The pause was to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s feelings dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> said:<p></p><p></p>
"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance."<p></p><p></p>
"I might as well inquire," replied <span class="transformed">he</span>, "why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against you—had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved <span class="transformed">brother</span>?"<p></p><p></p>
As <span class="transformed">he</span> pronounced these words, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> listened without attempting to interrupt <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> while <span class="transformed">he</span> continued:<p></p><p></p>
"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. You dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other—of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> paused, and saw with no slight indignation that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was listening with an air which proved <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> even looked at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with a smile of affected incredulity.<p></p><p></p>
"Can you deny that you have done it?" <span class="transformed">he</span> repeated.<p></p><p></p>
With assumed tranquillity <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> then replied: "I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your <span class="transformed">brother</span>, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> I have been kinder than towards myself."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"But it is not merely this affair," <span class="transformed">he</span> continued, "on which my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?"<p></p><p></p>
"You take an eager interest in that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>'s concerns," said Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.<p></p><p></p>
"Who that knows what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> misfortunes have been great indeed."<p></p><p></p>
"And of your infliction," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> with energy. "You have reduced <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> present state of poverty—comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. You have deprived the best years of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> life of that independence which was no less <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> due than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> desert. You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> misfortune with contempt and ridicule."<p></p><p></p>
"And this," cried Darcy, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, stopping in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> walk, and turning towards <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, "these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?—to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> felt <span class="transformed">himself</span> growing more angry every moment; yet <span class="transformed">he</span> tried to the utmost to speak with composure when <span class="transformed">he</span> said:<p></p><p></p>
"You are mistaken, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladylike</span></span> manner."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> saw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> start at this, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> said nothing, and <span class="transformed">he</span> continued:<p></p><p></p>
"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it."<p></p><p></p>
Again <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> astonishment was obvious; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> looked at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. <span class="transformed">He</span> went on:<p></p><p></p>
"From the very beginning—from the first moment, I may almost say—of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."<p></p><p></p>
"You have said quite enough, <span class="transformed">sir</span>. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness."<p></p><p></p>
And with these words <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> hastily left the room, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> heard <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> the next moment open the front door and quit the house.<p></p><p></p>
The tumult of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> mind, was now painfully great. <span class="transformed">He</span> knew not how to support <span class="transformed">himself</span>, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half-an-hour. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> astonishment, as <span class="transformed">he</span> reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. That <span class="transformed">he</span> should receive an offer of marriage from <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy! That <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should have been in love with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in spite of all the objections which had made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> prevent <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend's marrying <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, and which must appear at least with equal force in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own case—was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> pride, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> abominable pride—<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> shameless avowal of what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had done with respect to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>—<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had mentioned <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cruelty towards whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attachment had for a moment excited. <span class="transformed">He</span> continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>'s carriage made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feel how unequal <span class="transformed">he</span> was to encounter <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>'s observation, and hurried <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> away to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> room.<p></p><p></p>

When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which, proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her a keener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next—and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do.<p></p><p></p>
She could not think of Darcy's leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him.<p></p><p></p>
While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began:<p></p><p></p>
"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement; and the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her, immediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority—of its being a degradation—of the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his suit.<p></p><p></p>
In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite of all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer. He spoke of apprehension and anxiety, but his countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said:<p></p><p></p>
"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be felt, and if I could feel gratitude, I would now thank you. But I cannot—I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings dreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:<p></p><p></p>
"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance."<p></p><p></p>
"I might as well inquire," replied she, "why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I was uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against you—had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister?"<p></p><p></p>
As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued:<p></p><p></p>
"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there. You dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means of dividing them from each other—of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind."<p></p><p></p>
She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse. He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.<p></p><p></p>
"Can you deny that you have done it?" she repeated.<p></p><p></p>
With assumed tranquillity he then replied: "I have no wish of denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards him I have been kinder than towards myself."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.<p></p><p></p>
"But it is not merely this affair," she continued, "on which my dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?"<p></p><p></p>
"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns," said Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.<p></p><p></p>
"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?"<p></p><p></p>
"His misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed."<p></p><p></p>
"And of your infliction," cried Elizabeth with energy. "You have reduced him to his present state of poverty—comparative poverty. You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule."<p></p><p></p>
"And this," cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps," added he, stopping in his walk, and turning towards her, "these offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections?—to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said:<p></p><p></p>
"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner."<p></p><p></p>
She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:<p></p><p></p>
"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it."<p></p><p></p>
Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:<p></p><p></p>
"From the very beginning—from the first moment, I may almost say—of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."<p></p><p></p>
"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness."<p></p><p></p>
And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house.<p></p><p></p>
The tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for so many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend's marrying her sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case—was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride—his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane—his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine's carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte's observation, and hurried her away to her room.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes. <span class="transformed">He</span> could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, <span class="transformed">he</span> resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge <span class="transformed">himself</span> in air and exercise. <span class="transformed">He</span> was proceeding directly to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> favourite walk, when the recollection of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and instead of entering the park, <span class="transformed">he</span> turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and <span class="transformed">he</span> soon passed one of the gates into the ground.<p></p><p></p>
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, <span class="transformed">he</span> was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks which <span class="transformed">he</span> had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. <span class="transformed">He</span> was on the point of continuing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> walk, when <span class="transformed">he</span> caught a glimpse of a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> within the sort of grove which edged the park; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was moving that way; and, fearful of its being <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, <span class="transformed">he</span> was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near enough to see <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> name. <span class="transformed">He</span> had turned away; but on hearing <span class="transformed">himself</span> called, though in a voice which proved it to be <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, <span class="transformed">he</span> moved again towards the gate. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter, which <span class="transformed">he</span> instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?" And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.<p></p><p></p>
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> opened the letter, and, to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> way along the lane, <span class="transformed">he</span> then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:—<p></p><p></p>
"Be not alarmed, <span class="transformed">sir</span>, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.<p></p><p></p>
"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley from your <span class="transformed">brother</span>, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, a young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.<p></p><p></p>
"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your elder <span class="transformed">brother</span> to any other young <span class="transformed">man</span> in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your <span class="transformed">brother</span> had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> partiality for <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. Your <span class="transformed">brother</span> I also watched. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though <span class="transformed">he</span> received <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attentions with pleasure, <span class="transformed">he</span> did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. If you have not been mistaken here, I must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of your <span class="transformed">brother</span> must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> temper, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> heart was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> indifferent is certain—but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your <span class="transformed">father</span>'s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by <span class="transformed">himself</span>, by your three younger <span class="transformed">brothers</span>, and occasionally even by your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder <span class="transformed">brother</span>, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.<p></p><p></p>
"The part which I acted is now to be explained. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span>' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, we shortly resolved on joining <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> directly in London. We accordingly went—and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s indifference. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had before believed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to return <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own. To convince <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, therefore, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had deceived <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, was no very difficult point. To persuade <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> your <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley; but <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to see <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> without some danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.<p></p><p></p>
"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> connection with my family. Of what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has particularly accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham is the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span> of a very respectable <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> trust naturally inclined my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> to be of service to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; and on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Georgiana</span></span> Wickham, who was <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> godson, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> supported <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at school, and afterwards at Cambridge—most important assistance, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, always poor from the extravagance of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>, would have been unable to give <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>'s education. My <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> was not only fond of this young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>'s society, whose manners were always engaging; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had also the highest opinion of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and hoping the church would be <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> profession, intended to provide for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in a very different manner. The vicious propensities—the want of principle, which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was careful to guard from the knowledge of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> best friend, could not escape the observation of a young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> of nearly the same age with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, and who had opportunities of seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in unguarded moments, which <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain—to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> real character—it adds even another motive.<p></p><p></p>
"My excellent <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> died about five years ago; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attachment to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> will <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> particularly recommended it to me, to promote <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> advancement in the best manner that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> profession might allow—and if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> own <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> hoped I should not think it unreasonable for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could not be benefited. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had some intention, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> added, of studying law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> proposal. I knew that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon settled—<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to invite <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to Pemberley, or admit <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> society in town. In town I believe <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> chiefly lived, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For about three years I heard little of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> applied to me again by letter for the presentation. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> circumstances, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to the living in question—of which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> trusted there could be little doubt, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> resentment was in proportion to the distress of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> circumstances—and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was doubtless as violent in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> abuse of me to others as in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> lived I know not. But last summer <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.<p></p><p></p>
"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My <span class="transformed">brother</span>, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my <span class="transformed">father</span>'s <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span>, Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>, and myself. About a year ago, <span class="transformed">he</span> was taken from school, and an establishment formed for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in London; and last summer <span class="transformed">he</span> went with the <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> connivance and aid, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> so far recommended <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> kindness to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> as a child, that <span class="transformed">he</span> was persuaded to believe <span class="transformed">himself</span> in love, and to consent to an elopement. <span class="transformed">He</span> was then but fifteen, which must be <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> excuse; and after stating <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to <span class="transformed">himself</span>. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> whom <span class="transformed">he</span> almost looked up to as a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Younge was of course removed from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> charge. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> on me was a strong inducement. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> revenge would have been complete indeed.<p></p><p></p>
"This, <span class="transformed">sir</span>, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had imposed on you; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> success is not perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.<p></p><p></p>
"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but I was not then <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span> enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the possibility of consulting <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning. I will only add, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Goddess</span></span> bless you.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground.<p></p><p></p>
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?" And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.<p></p><p></p>
With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:—<p></p><p></p>
"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I demand it of your justice.<p></p><p></p>
"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.<p></p><p></p>
"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental information, that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I observed my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced from the evening's scrutiny, that though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment. If you have not been mistaken here, I must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister's countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain—but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have the utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.<p></p><p></p>
"The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly went—and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference. He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.<p></p><p></p>
"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he has particularly accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.<p></p><p></p>
"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge—most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman's education. My father was not only fond of this young man's society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities—the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain—to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character—it adds even another motive.<p></p><p></p>
"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow—and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying law, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed him to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the business was therefore soon settled—he resigned all claim to assistance in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question—of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances—and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.<p></p><p></p>
"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham's chief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed.<p></p><p></p>
"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.<p></p><p></p>
"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed.

<p></p><p></p>
If <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, when <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy gave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> offers, <span class="transformed">he</span> had formed no expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly <span class="transformed">he</span> went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> feelings as <span class="transformed">he</span> read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did <span class="transformed">he</span> first understand that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> believed any apology to be in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> power; and steadfastly was <span class="transformed">he</span> persuaded, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might say, <span class="transformed">he</span> began <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> account of what had happened at Netherfield. <span class="transformed">He</span> read with an eagerness which hardly left <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> belief of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s insensibility <span class="transformed">he</span> instantly resolved to be false; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> too angry to have any wish of doing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> justice. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> expressed no regret for what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had done which satisfied <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.<p></p><p></p>
But when this subject was succeeded by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> account of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham—when <span class="transformed">he</span> read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own history of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>—<span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"—and when <span class="transformed">he</span> had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that <span class="transformed">he</span> would not regard it, that <span class="transformed">he</span> would never look in it again.<p></p><p></p>
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, <span class="transformed">he</span> walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting <span class="transformed">himself</span> as well as <span class="transformed">he</span> could, <span class="transformed">he</span> again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded <span class="transformed">himself</span> so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had related <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>; and the kindness of the late <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, though <span class="transformed">he</span> had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when <span class="transformed">he</span> came to the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> memory, and as <span class="transformed">he</span> recalled <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, <span class="transformed">he</span> flattered <span class="transformed">himself</span> that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> wishes did not err. But when <span class="transformed">he</span> read and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was <span class="transformed">he</span> forced to hesitate. <span class="transformed">He</span> put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what <span class="transformed">he</span> meant to be impartiality—deliberated on the probability of each statement—but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again <span class="transformed">he</span> read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which <span class="transformed">he</span> had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> entirely blameless throughout the whole.<p></p><p></p>
The extravagance and general profligacy which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> scrupled not to lay at <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; the more so, as <span class="transformed">he</span> could bring no proof of its injustice. <span class="transformed">He</span> had never heard of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> entrance into the ——shire Militia, in which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had engaged at the persuasion of the young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> who, on meeting <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> told <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>. As to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> real character, had information been in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> power, <span class="transformed">he</span> had never felt a wish of inquiring. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> countenance, voice, and manner had established <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at once in the possession of every virtue. <span class="transformed">He</span> tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> from the attacks of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under which <span class="transformed">he</span> would endeavour to class what <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But no such recollection befriended <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> could see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> instantly before <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, in every charm of air and address; but <span class="transformed">he</span> could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> social powers had gained <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, <span class="transformed">he</span> once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> designs on <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span> and <span class="transformed">himself</span> only the morning before; and at last <span class="transformed">he</span> was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>—from whom <span class="transformed">he</span> had previously received the information of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> near concern in all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousin's affairs, and whose character <span class="transformed">he</span> had no reason to question. At one time <span class="transformed">he</span> had almost resolved on applying to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had not been well assured of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousin's corroboration.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and <span class="transformed">himself</span>, in their first evening at <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Phillips's. Many of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> expressions were still fresh in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> memory. <span class="transformed">He</span> was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> before. <span class="transformed">He</span> saw the indelicacy of putting <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> forward as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had done, and the inconsistency of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> professions with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> conduct. <span class="transformed">He</span> remembered that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had boasted of having no fear of seeing <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy—that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy might leave the country, but that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should stand <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> ground; yet <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. <span class="transformed">He</span> remembered also that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had told <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> story to no one but <span class="transformed">himself</span>; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's character, though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had assured <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that respect for the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> would always prevent <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> exposing the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
How differently did everything now appear in which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was concerned! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> attentions to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Mr King</span></span> were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> fortune proved no longer the moderation of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> wishes, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> eagerness to grasp at anything. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> behaviour to <span class="transformed">himself</span> could now have had no tolerable motive; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had either been deceived with regard to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> fortune, or had been gratifying <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> vanity by encouraging the preference which <span class="transformed">he</span> believed <span class="transformed">he</span> had most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not but allow that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, when questioned by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, had long ago asserted <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> manners, <span class="transformed">he</span> had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance—an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> a sort of intimacy with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> ways—seen anything that betrayed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to be unprincipled or unjust—anything that spoke <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> of irreligious or immoral habits; that among <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own connections <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was esteemed and valued—that even Wickham had allowed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> merit as a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, and that <span class="transformed">he</span> had often heard <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> speak so affectionately of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> as to prove <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> capable of some amiable feeling; that had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> actions been what <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> as <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, was incomprehensible.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> grew absolutely ashamed of <span class="transformed">himself</span>. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could <span class="transformed">he</span> think without feeling <span class="transformed">he</span> had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.<p></p><p></p>
"How despicably I have acted!" <span class="transformed">he</span> cried; "I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my <span class="transformed">brother</span>, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself."<p></p><p></p>
From <span class="transformed">himself</span> to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>—from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> to Bingley, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> thoughts were in a line which soon brought to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> recollection that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's explanation there had appeared very insufficient, and <span class="transformed">he</span> read it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal. How could <span class="transformed">he</span> deny that credit to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> assertions in one instance, which <span class="transformed">he</span> had been obliged to give in the other? <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> declared <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> to be totally unsuspicious of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s attachment; and <span class="transformed">he</span> could not help remembering what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>'s opinion had always been. Neither could <span class="transformed">he</span> deny the justice of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> description of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> felt that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> air and manner not often united with great sensibility.<p></p><p></p>
When <span class="transformed">he</span> came to that part of the letter in which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> mind than on hers.<p></p><p></p>
The compliment to <span class="transformed">himself</span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> was not unfelt. It soothed, but it could not console <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for the contempt which had thus been self-attracted by the rest of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family; and as <span class="transformed">he</span> considered that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s disappointment had in fact been the work of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, <span class="transformed">he</span> felt depressed beyond anything <span class="transformed">he</span> had ever known before.<p></p><p></p>
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought—re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling <span class="transformed">himself</span>, as well as <span class="transformed">he</span> could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> long absence, made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> at length return home; and <span class="transformed">he</span> entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> unfit for conversation.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> was immediately told that the two <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> from Rosings had each called during <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> absence; <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take leave—but that Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span> had been sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> return, and almost resolving to walk after <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> till <span class="transformed">he</span> could be found. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could but just affect concern in missing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; <span class="transformed">he</span> really rejoiced at it. Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span> was no longer an object; <span class="transformed">he</span> could think only of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> letter.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited. Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power; and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and insolence.<p></p><p></p>
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham—when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself—her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false! This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!"—and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again.<p></p><p></p>
In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on nothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence. The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality—deliberated on the probability of each statement—but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.<p></p><p></p>
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at Mr. Wickham's charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his entrance into the ——shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years' continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself—from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin's corroboration.<p></p><p></p>
She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips's. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy—that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that he should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son.<p></p><p></p>
How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance—an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways—seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust—anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued—that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.<p></p><p></p>
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd.<p></p><p></p>
"How despicably I have acted!" she cried; "I, who have prided myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself."<p></p><p></p>
From herself to Jane—from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation there had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to give in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte's opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings, though fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility.<p></p><p></p>
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers.<p></p><p></p>
The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that Jane's disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before.<p></p><p></p>
After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every variety of thought—re-considering events, determining probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation.<p></p><p></p>

Elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object; she could think only of her letter.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
The two <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> left Rosings the next morning, and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> then hastened, to console <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>; and on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship, importing that <span class="transformed">he</span> felt <span class="transformed">himself</span> so dull as to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> very desirous of having them all to dine with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could not see <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> without recollecting that, had <span class="transformed">he</span> chosen it, <span class="transformed">he</span> might by this time have been presented to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> future <span class="transformed">nephew</span>; nor could <span class="transformed">he</span> think, without a smile, of what <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship's indignation would have been. "What would <span class="transformed">he</span> have said? how would <span class="transformed">he</span> have behaved?" were questions with which <span class="transformed">he</span> amused <span class="transformed">himself</span>.<p></p><p></p>
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. "I assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>; "I believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to these young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span>, and know them to be so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> attachment to Rosings certainly increases."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the <span class="transformed">father</span> and <span class="transformed">son</span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> observed, after dinner, that <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by <span class="transformed">himself</span>, by supposing that <span class="transformed">he</span> did not like to go home again so soon, <span class="transformed">he</span> added:<p></p><p></p>
"But if that is the case, you must write to your <span class="transformed">father</span> and beg that you may stay a little longer. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure."<p></p><p></p>
"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town next Saturday."<p></p><p></p>
"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months. I told <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins so before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight."<p></p><p></p>
"But my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> cannot. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> wrote last week to hurry my return."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> of course may spare you, if your <span class="transformed">father</span> can. <span class="transformed">Sons</span> are never of so much consequence to a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>. And if you will stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you—and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."<p></p><p></p>
"You are all kindness, <span class="transformed">sir</span>; but I believe we must abide by our original plan."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> seemed resigned. "<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young <span class="transformed">men</span> travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young <span class="transformed">men</span> should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my <span class="transformed">nephew</span> Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> having two <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span>-servants go with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy, the <span class="transformed">son</span> of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, of Pemberley, and <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Aubrey</span></span>, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span>, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone."<p></p><p></p>
"My <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> is to send a servant for us."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! Your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> keeps a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>-servant, does <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as <span class="transformed">he</span> did not answer them all <span class="transformed">himself</span>, attention was necessary, which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> believed to be lucky for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; or, with a mind so occupied, <span class="transformed">he</span> might have forgotten where <span class="transformed">he</span> was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever <span class="transformed">he</span> was alone, <span class="transformed">he</span> gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which <span class="transformed">he</span> might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's letter <span class="transformed">he</span> was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. <span class="transformed">He</span> studied every sentence; and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. When <span class="transformed">he</span> remembered the style of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> address, <span class="transformed">he</span> was still full of indignation; but when <span class="transformed">he</span> considered how unjustly <span class="transformed">he</span> had condemned and upbraided <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> anger was turned against <span class="transformed">himself</span>; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> attachment excited gratitude, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> general character respect; but <span class="transformed">he</span> could not approve <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; nor could <span class="transformed">he</span> for a moment repent <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> again. In <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, contented with laughing at them, would never exert <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> to restrain the wild giddiness of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> youngest <span class="transformed">sons</span>; and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, with manners so far from right <span class="transformed">himself</span>, was entirely insensible of the evil. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had frequently united with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> in an endeavour to check the imprudence of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>; but while they were supported by their <span class="transformed">father</span>'s indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there forever.<p></p><p></p>
Anxiety on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s behalf was another prevailing concern; and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> former good opinion, heightened the sense of what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had lost. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> affection was proved to have been sincere, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> confidence in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own family!<p></p><p></p>
When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to appear tolerably cheerful.<p></p><p></p>
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent there; and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought <span class="transformed">himself</span> obliged, on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> trunk afresh.<p></p><p></p>
When they parted, <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh exerted <span class="transformed">himself</span> so far as to curtsey and hold out <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> hand to both.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then hastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship, importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her ladyship's indignation would have been. "What would she have said? how would she have behaved?" were questions with which she amused herself.<p></p><p></p>
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. "I assure you, I feel it exceedingly," said Lady Catherine; "I believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His attachment to Rosings certainly increases."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.<p></p><p></p>
Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added:<p></p><p></p>
"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure."<p></p><p></p>
"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation," replied Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town next Saturday."<p></p><p></p>
"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight."<p></p><p></p>
"But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay another month complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you—and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."<p></p><p></p>
"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan."<p></p><p></p>
Lady Catherine seemed resigned. "Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone."<p></p><p></p>
"My uncle is to send a servant for us."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to."<p></p><p></p>
Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She studied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different. When she remembered the style of his address, she was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion. His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence, what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited, irritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there forever.<p></p><p></p>
Anxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy's explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!<p></p><p></p>
When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.<p></p><p></p>
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent there; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the work of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.<p></p><p></p>
When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
On Saturday morning <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> deemed indispensably necessary.<p></p><p></p>
"I know not, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "whether <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins has yet expressed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> thanks for it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> like yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was eager with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> thanks and assurances of happiness. <span class="transformed">He</span> had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>, and the kind attentions <span class="transformed">he</span> had received, must make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feel the obliged. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling solemnity replied:<p></p><p></p>
"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>'s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings."<p></p><p></p>
Words were insufficient for the elevation of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> feelings; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was obliged to walk about the room, while <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.<p></p><p></p>
"You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>'s great attentions to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate—but on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear <span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each other."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that <span class="transformed">he</span> firmly believed and rejoiced in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> domestic comforts. <span class="transformed">He</span> was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> from whom they sprang. Poor <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>! it was melancholy to leave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to such society! But <span class="transformed">he</span> had chosen it with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes open; and though evidently regretting that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> visitors were to go, <span class="transformed">he</span> did not seem to ask for compassion. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> home and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> housekeeping, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> parish and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.<p></p><p></p>
At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate parting between the friends, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was attended to the carriage by <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, and as they walked down the garden <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was commissioning <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> best respects to all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family, not forgetting <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> thanks for the kindness <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had received at Longbourn in the winter, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> compliments to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, though unknown. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> then handed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> at Rosings.<p></p><p></p>
"But," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> added, "you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off.<p></p><p></p>
"Good gracious!" cried Maria, after a few minutes' silence, "it seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have happened!"<p></p><p></p>
"A great many indeed," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> companion with a sigh.<p></p><p></p>
"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice! How much I shall have to tell!"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> added privately, "And how much I shall have to conceal!"<p></p><p></p>
Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> looked well, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had little opportunity of studying <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> spirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span> had reserved for them. But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was to go home with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.<p></p><p></p>
It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that <span class="transformed">he</span> could wait even for Longbourn, before <span class="transformed">he</span> told <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's proposals. To know that <span class="transformed">he</span> had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own vanity <span class="transformed">he</span> had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which <span class="transformed">he</span> remained as to the extent of what <span class="transformed">he</span> should communicate; and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> fear, if <span class="transformed">he</span> once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> further.<p></p><p></p>

She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make her feel the obliged.

Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society!

It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy's proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister further.<p></p><p></p>

It was the second week in May, in which the three young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ——, in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> looking out of a dining-room up stairs. These two <span class="transformed">boys</span> had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.<p></p><p></p>
After welcoming their <span class="transformed">brothers</span>, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?"<p></p><p></p>
"And we mean to treat you all," added <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then, showing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> purchases—"Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better."<p></p><p></p>
And when <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> abused it as ugly, <span class="transformed">he</span> added, with perfect unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ——shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight."<p></p><p></p>
"Are they indeed!" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, with the greatest satisfaction.<p></p><p></p>
"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mamma</span></span> to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. <span class="transformed">Papa</span> would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes," thought <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "that would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!"<p></p><p></p>
"Now I have got some news for you," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, as they sat down at table. "What do you think? It is excellent news—capital news—and about a certain person we all like!"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> looked at each other, and the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">waitress</span></span> was told <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> need not stay. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> laughed, and said:<p></p><p></p>
"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">waitress</span></span> must not hear, as if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> cared! I dare say <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is an ugly fellow! I am glad <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">waitress</span></span>, is it not? There is no danger of Wickham's marrying <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Queen</span></span>. There's for you! <span class="transformed">He</span> is gone down to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe."<p></p><p></p>
"And <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Queen</span></span> is safe!" added <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">He</span> is a great fool for going away, if <span class="transformed">he</span> liked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"I am sure there is not on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. I will answer for it, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> never cared three straws about <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>—who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of expression <span class="transformed">himself</span>, the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!<p></p><p></p>
As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>'s and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s purchases, were seated in it.<p></p><p></p>
"How nicely we are all crammed in," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>. "I am glad I bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span>? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> before you came back. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. <span class="transformed">He</span> is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three-and-twenty! My <span class="transformed">uncle</span> Phillips wants you so to get <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wives</span></span>, you can't think. <span class="transformed">He</span> says <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span> had better have taken <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> and me were to spend the day there, and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Forster and me are such friends!) and so <span class="transformed">he</span> asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by <span class="transformed">himself</span>; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in <span class="transformed">man</span>'s clothes on purpose to pass for a <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Forster, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> and me, except my <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, for we were forced to borrow one of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> gowns; and you cannot imagine how well <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span> came in, they did not know <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Forster. I thought I should have died. And that made the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span> suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter."<p></p><p></p>
With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, assisted by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>'s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> companions all the way to Longbourn. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> listened as little as <span class="transformed">he</span> could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.<p></p><p></p>
Their reception at home was most kind. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet rejoiced to see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet say voluntarily to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>:<p></p><p></p>
"I am glad you are come back, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that occupied them: <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span> was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eldest <span class="transformed">son</span>; <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, who sat some way below <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span>," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! As we went along, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> had not been sick; and when we got to the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Georgiana</span></span>, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!"<p></p><p></p>
To this <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear <span class="transformed">brother</span>, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of <span class="transformed">male</span> minds. But I confess they would have no charms for me—I should infinitely prefer a book."<p></p><p></p>
But of this answer <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> heard not a word. <span class="transformed">He</span> seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> at all.<p></p><p></p>
In the afternoon <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> was urgent with the rest of the <span class="transformed">boys</span> to walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> opposition. <span class="transformed">He</span> dreaded seeing <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> of the regiment's approaching removal was indeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go—and once gone, <span class="transformed">he</span> hoped there could be nothing more to plague <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> account.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> had not been many hours at home before <span class="transformed">he</span> found that the Brighton scheme, of which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> parents. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> saw directly that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> had not the smallest intention of yielding; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ——, in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet's carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman's punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs. These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad and cucumber.<p></p><p></p>
After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?"<p></p><p></p>
"And we mean to treat you all," added Lydia, "but you must lend us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there." Then, showing her purchases—"Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any better."<p></p><p></p>
And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, "Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ——shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight."<p></p><p></p>
"Are they indeed!" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.<p></p><p></p>
"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "that would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!"<p></p><p></p>
"Now I have got some news for you," said Lydia, as they sat down at table. "What do you think? It is excellent news—capital news—and about a certain person we all like!"<p></p><p></p>
Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:<p></p><p></p>
"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King. There's for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe."<p></p><p></p>
"And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune."<p></p><p></p>
"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."<p></p><p></p>
"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side," said Jane.<p></p><p></p>
"I am sure there is not on his. I will answer for it, he never cared three straws about her—who could about such a nasty little freckled thing?"<p></p><p></p>

"Oh! Mary," said she, "I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too.

But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.<p></p><p></p>

She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents.

<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s impatience to acquaint <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular in which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> was concerned, and preparing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to be surprised, <span class="transformed">he</span> related to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> the next morning the chief of the scene between <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy and <span class="transformed">himself</span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. <span class="transformed">He</span> was sorry that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy should have delivered <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was <span class="transformed">he</span> grieved for the unhappiness which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s refusal must have given <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> being so sure of succeeding was wrong," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> disappointment!"<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "I am heartily sorry for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"Blame you! Oh, no."<p></p><p></p>
"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?"<p></p><p></p>
"No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."<p></p><p></p>
"But you will know it, when I tell you what happened the very next day."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Georgiana</span></span> Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feelings, capable of consoling <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for such discovery. Most earnestly did <span class="transformed">he</span> labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one without involving the other.<p></p><p></p>
"This will not do," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; "you never will be able to make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's; but you shall do as you choose."<p></p><p></p>
It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said <span class="transformed">he</span>. "Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy! Dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, only consider what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather."<p></p><p></p>
"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> countenance! such an openness and gentleness in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> manner!"<p></p><p></p>
"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span>. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it."<p></p><p></p>
"I never thought <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do."<p></p><p></p>
"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> without now and then stumbling on something witty."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now."<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!"<p></p><p></p>
"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved."<p></p><p></p>
"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham's character."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet paused a little, and then replied, "Surely there can be no occasion for exposing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> so dreadfully. What is your opinion?"<p></p><p></p>
"That it ought not to be attempted. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy has not authorised me to make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> communication public. On the contrary, every particular relative to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say nothing about it."<p></p><p></p>
"You are quite right. To have <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> errors made public might ruin <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> for ever. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is now, perhaps, sorry for what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has done, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> desperate."<p></p><p></p>
The tumult of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s mind was allayed by this conversation. <span class="transformed">He</span> had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, whenever <span class="transformed">he</span> might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. <span class="transformed">He</span> dared not relate the other half of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's letter, nor explain to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> how sincerely <span class="transformed">he</span> had been valued by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and <span class="transformed">he</span> was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. "And then," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s spirits. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was not happy. <span class="transformed">He</span> still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied <span class="transformed">himself</span> in love before, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so fervently did <span class="transformed">he</span> value <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> remembrance, and prefer <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to every other <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, that all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> good sense, and all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> attention to the feelings of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own health and their tranquillity.<p></p><p></p>
"Well, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet one day, "what is your opinion now of this sad business of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my <span class="transformed">brother</span> Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> saw anything of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in London. Well, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is a very undeserving young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>—and I do not suppose there's the least chance in the world of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ever getting <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> now. There is no talk of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know."<p></p><p></p>
"I do not believe <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will ever live at Netherfield any more."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh well! it is just as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> chooses. Nobody wants <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to come. Though I shall always say <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> used my <span class="transformed">son</span> extremely ill; and if I was <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> will die of a broken heart; and then <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will be sorry for what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has done."<p></p><p></p>
But as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could not receive comfort from any such expectation, <span class="transformed">he</span> made no answer.<p></p><p></p>
"Well, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>," continued <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, soon afterwards, "and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> is an excellent <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">manageress</span></span>, I dare say. If <span class="transformed">he</span> is half as sharp as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping, I dare say."<p></p><p></p>
"No, nothing at all."<p></p><p></p>
"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes. they will take care not to outrun their income. They will never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens."<p></p><p></p>
"It was a subject which they could not mention before me."<p></p><p></p>
"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me."<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.<p></p><p></p>
Miss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.<p></p><p></p>
"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong," said she, "and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment!"<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed," replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"<p></p><p></p>
"Blame you! Oh, no."<p></p><p></p>
"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?"<p></p><p></p>
"No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."<p></p><p></p>
"But you will know it, when I tell you what happened the very next day."<p></p><p></p>
She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was Darcy's vindication, though grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery. Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one without involving the other.<p></p><p></p>
"This will not do," said Elizabeth; "you never will be able to make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy's; but you shall do as you choose."<p></p><p></p>
It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.<p></p><p></p>
"I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she. "Wickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather."<p></p><p></p>
"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!"<p></p><p></p>
"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it."<p></p><p></p>
"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the appearance of it as you used to do."<p></p><p></p>
"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty."<p></p><p></p>
"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now."<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!"<p></p><p></p>
"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they do appear wholly undeserved."<p></p><p></p>
"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham's character."<p></p><p></p>
Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, "Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?"<p></p><p></p>
"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say nothing about it."<p></p><p></p>
"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate."<p></p><p></p>
The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery. "And then," said she, "if that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!"<p></p><p></p>
She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity.<p></p><p></p>
"Well, Lizzy," said Mrs. Bennet one day, "what is your opinion now of this sad business of Jane's? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London.

"I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it.

But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.<p></p><p></p>
"Well, Lizzy," continued her mother, soon afterwards, "and so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do they keep?

The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal. The elder <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.<p></p><p></p>
"Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. "How can you be smiling so, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
Their affectionate <span class="transformed">father</span> shared all their grief; <span class="transformed">he</span> remembered what <span class="transformed">he</span> had <span class="transformed">himself</span> endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years ago.<p></p><p></p>
"I am sure," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart."<p></p><p></p>
"I am sure I shall break mine," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, yes!—if one could but go to Brighton! But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mamma</span></span> is so disagreeable."<p></p><p></p>
"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever."<p></p><p></p>
"And my <span class="transformed">uncle</span> Phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good," added <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. <span class="transformed">He</span> felt anew the justice of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's objections; and never had <span class="transformed">he</span> been so much disposed to pardon <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> interference in the views of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend.<p></p><p></p>
But the gloom of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s prospect was shortly cleared away; for <span class="transformed">he</span> received an invitation from <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Forster, the <span class="transformed">husband</span> of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young <span class="transformed">man</span>, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> to each other, and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two.<p></p><p></p>
The rapture of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> on this occasion, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> adoration of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Forster, the delight of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, and the mortification of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s feelings, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> continued in the parlour repined at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> fate in terms as unreasonable as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> accent was peevish.<p></p><p></p>
"I cannot see why <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Forster should not ask me as well as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "Though I am not <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as <span class="transformed">he</span> has, and more too, for I am two years older."<p></p><p></p>
In vain did <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> attempt to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> reasonable, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> resigned. As for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> <span class="transformed">himself</span>, this invitation was so far from exciting in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> the same feelings as in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, that <span class="transformed">he</span> considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> were it known, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not help secretly advising <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> not to let <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> go. <span class="transformed">He</span> represented to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> all the improprieties of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s general behaviour, the little advantage <span class="transformed">he</span> could derive from the friendship of such a <span class="transformed">man</span> as <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Forster, and the probability of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> heard <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> attentively, and then said:<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> will never be easy until <span class="transformed">he</span> has exposed <span class="transformed">himself</span> in some public place or other, and we can never expect <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family as under the present circumstances."<p></p><p></p>
"If you were aware," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s unguarded and imprudent manner—nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair."<p></p><p></p>
"Already arisen?" repeated <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet. "What, has <span class="transformed">he</span> frightened away some of your lovers? Poor little <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>! But do not be cast down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s folly."<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, will not take the trouble of checking <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> exuberant spirits, and of teaching <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> present pursuits are not to be the business of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> life, <span class="transformed">he</span> will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> character will be fixed, and <span class="transformed">he</span> will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made <span class="transformed">himself</span> or <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> rage for admiration will excite. In this danger <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> also is comprehended. <span class="transformed">He</span> will follow wherever <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their <span class="transformed">brothers</span> will not be often involved in the disgrace?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet saw that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> whole heart was in the subject, and affectionately taking <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> hand said in reply:<p></p><p></p>
"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> are known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three—very silly <span class="transformed">brothers</span>. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> does not go to Brighton. Let <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, and will keep <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> out of any real mischief; and <span class="transformed">he</span> is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At Brighton <span class="transformed">he</span> will be of less importance even as a common flirt than <span class="transformed">he</span> has been here. The officers will find <span class="transformed">men</span> better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> being there may teach <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own insignificance. At any rate, <span class="transformed">he</span> cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> up for the rest of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> life."<p></p><p></p>
With this answer <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was forced to be content; but <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own opinion continued the same, and <span class="transformed">he</span> left <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> disappointed and sorry. It was not in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> nature, however, to increase <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> vexations by dwelling on them. <span class="transformed">He</span> was confident of having performed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> disposition.<p></p><p></p>
Had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> known the substance of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> conference with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility. In <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. <span class="transformed">He</span> saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. <span class="transformed">He</span> saw <span class="transformed">himself</span> the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown. <span class="transformed">He</span> saw all the glories of the camp—its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, <span class="transformed">he</span> saw <span class="transformed">himself</span> seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.<p></p><p></p>
Had <span class="transformed">he</span> known <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> sought to tear <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> sensations? They could have been understood only by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, who might have felt nearly the same. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s going to Brighton was all that consoled <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> melancholy conviction of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>'s never intending to go there <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s leaving home.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was now to see <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham for the last time. Having been frequently in company with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> since <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. <span class="transformed">He</span> had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> present behaviour to <span class="transformed">himself</span>, moreover, <span class="transformed">he</span> had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> lost all concern for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in finding <span class="transformed">himself</span> thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while <span class="transformed">he</span> steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attentions had been withdrawn, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> vanity would be gratified, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> preference secured at any time by their renewal.<p></p><p></p>
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> dined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> disposed to part from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in good humour, that on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> making some inquiry as to the manner in which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> time had passed at Hunsford, <span class="transformed">he</span> mentioned Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>'s and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was acquainted with the former.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had formerly seen <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> often; and, after observing that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was a very <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladylike</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, asked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> how <span class="transformed">he</span> had liked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> answer was warmly in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> favour. With an air of indifference <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> soon afterwards added:<p></p><p></p>
"How long did you say <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was at Rosings?"<p></p><p></p>
"Nearly three weeks."<p></p><p></p>
"And you saw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> frequently?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, almost every day."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> manners are very different from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousin's."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, very different. But I think <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy improves upon acquaintance."<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed!" cried <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham with a look which did not escape <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. "And pray, may I ask?—" But checking <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> added, in a gayer tone, "Is it in address that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> improves? Has <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> deigned to add aught of civility to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> ordinary style?—for I dare not hope," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is improved in essentials."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, no!" said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>. "In essentials, I believe, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is very much what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> ever was."<p></p><p></p>
While <span class="transformed">he</span> spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a something in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> countenance which made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while <span class="transformed">he</span> added:<p></p><p></p>
"When I said that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> mind or <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> better, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> disposition was better understood."<p></p><p></p>
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was silent, till, shaking off <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> embarrassment, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> turned to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> again, and said in the gentlest of accents:<p></p><p></p>
"You, who so well know my feeling towards <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, to many others, for it must only deter <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> visits to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, of whose good opinion and judgement <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> stands much in awe. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> fear of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> wish of forwarding the match with <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh, which I am certain <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has very much at heart."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could not repress a smile at this, but <span class="transformed">he</span> answered only by a slight inclination of the head. <span class="transformed">He</span> saw that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> wanted to engage <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> on the old subject of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> grievances, and <span class="transformed">he</span> was in no humour to indulge <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. The rest of the evening passed with the appearance, on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.<p></p><p></p>
When the party broke up, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> returned with <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family was rather noisy than pathetic. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> was the only one who shed tears; but <span class="transformed">he</span> did weep from vexation and envy. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was diffuse in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> good wishes for the felicity of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>, and impressive in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> injunctions that <span class="transformed">he</span> should not <span class="transformed">mr</span> the opportunity of enjoying <span class="transformed">himself</span> as much as possible—advice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> <span class="transformed">himself</span> in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> were uttered without being heard.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p></article><article class="right"><p></p><h1>Chapter 41</h1><p></p><p></p>
<p></p><p></p>
The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was the last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in any of the family.<p></p><p></p>
"Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?" would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. "How can you be smiling so, Lizzy?"<p></p><p></p>
Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years ago.<p></p><p></p>
"I am sure," said she, "I cried for two days together when Colonel Miller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart."<p></p><p></p>
"I am sure I shall break mine," said Lydia.<p></p><p></p>
"If one could but go to Brighton!" observed Mrs. Bennet.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, yes!—if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable."<p></p><p></p>
"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever."<p></p><p></p>
"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do me a great deal of good," added Kitty.<p></p><p></p>
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend.<p></p><p></p>
But the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their three months' acquaintance they had been intimate two.<p></p><p></p>
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.<p></p><p></p>
"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask me as well as Lydia," said she, "Though I am not her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older."<p></p><p></p>
In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia's general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:<p></p><p></p>
"Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances."<p></p><p></p>
"If you were aware," said Elizabeth, "of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner—nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair."<p></p><p></p>
"Already arisen?" repeated Mr. Bennet. "What, has she frightened away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydia's character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character will be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain, ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace?"<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and affectionately taking her hand said in reply:<p></p><p></p>
"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three—very silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life."<p></p><p></p>
With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her disposition.<p></p><p></p>
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility. In Lydia's imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp—its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once.<p></p><p></p>
Had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same. Lydia's going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husband's never intending to go there himself.<p></p><p></p>
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia's leaving home.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.<p></p><p></p>
On the very last day of the regiment's remaining at Meryton, he dined, with other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.<p></p><p></p>
He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment's recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man, asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour. With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:<p></p><p></p>
"How long did you say he was at Rosings?"<p></p><p></p>
"Nearly three weeks."<p></p><p></p>
"And you saw him frequently?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, almost every day."<p></p><p></p>
"His manners are very different from his cousin's."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance."<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed!" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. "And pray, may I ask?—" But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, "Is it in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary style?—for I dare not hope," he continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he is improved in essentials."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, no!" said Elizabeth. "In essentials, I believe, he is very much what he ever was."<p></p><p></p>
While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added:<p></p><p></p>
"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood."<p></p><p></p>
Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents:<p></p><p></p>
"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right. His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with the appearance, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.<p></p><p></p>
When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter, and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible—advice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s opinion been all drawn from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own family, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a <span class="transformed">man</span> whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> principal enjoyments. To <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was very little otherwise indebted, than as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ignorance and folly had contributed to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> would in general wish to owe to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s behaviour as a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> had always seen it with pain; but respecting <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> abilities, and grateful for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> affectionate treatment of <span class="transformed">himself</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> endeavoured to forget what <span class="transformed">he</span> could not overlook, and to banish from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span> to the contempt of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own children, was so highly reprehensible. But <span class="transformed">he</span> had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">sons</span>, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>.<p></p><p></p>
When <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had rejoiced over Wickham's departure <span class="transformed">he</span> found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home <span class="transformed">he</span> had a <span class="transformed">father</span> and <span class="transformed">brother</span> whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> might in time regain <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> brain were removed, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> other <span class="transformed">brother</span>, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, <span class="transformed">he</span> found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which <span class="transformed">he</span> had been looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction <span class="transformed">he</span> had promised <span class="transformed">himself</span>. It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity—to have some other point on which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console <span class="transformed">himself</span> for the present, and prepare for another disappointment. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> tour to the Lakes was now the object of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> happiest thoughts; it was <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> made inevitable; and could <span class="transformed">he</span> have included <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.<p></p><p></p>
"But it is fortunate," thought <span class="transformed">he</span>, "that I have something to wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation."<p></p><p></p>
When <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> went away <span class="transformed">he</span> promised to write very often and very minutely to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>; but <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> contained little else than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where <span class="transformed">he</span> had seen such <span class="transformed">handsome</span> ornaments as made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> quite wild; that <span class="transformed">he</span> had a new gown, or a new parasol, which <span class="transformed">he</span> would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Forster called <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and they were going off to the camp; and from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> correspondence with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, there was still less to be learnt—for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> letters to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.<p></p><p></p>
After the first fortnight or three weeks of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was restored to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> hope that by the following Christmas <span class="transformed">he</span> might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.<p></p><p></p>
The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks; and to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The town where <span class="transformed">he</span> had formerly passed some years of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> life, and where they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the Peak.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was excessively disappointed; <span class="transformed">he</span> had set <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> heart on seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it was <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> business to be satisfied—and certainly <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.<p></p><p></p>
With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was impossible for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner. "But surely," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "I may enter <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> perceiving me."<p></p><p></p>
The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away before <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span>'s arrival. But they did pass away, and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn. The children, two <span class="transformed">boys</span> of six and eight years old, and two younger <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">girls</span></span>, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for attending to them in every way—teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.<p></p><p></p>
The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment was certain—that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences—cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure—and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad.<p></p><p></p>
It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner's former residence, and where <span class="transformed">he</span> had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> found from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span> that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking over their route the evening before, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner declared <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> willingness, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was applied to for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> approbation.<p></p><p></p>
"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?" said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span>; "a place, too, with which so many of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> youth there, you know."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was distressed. <span class="transformed">He</span> felt that <span class="transformed">he</span> had no business at Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. <span class="transformed">He</span> must own that <span class="transformed">he</span> was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so many, <span class="transformed">he</span> really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner abused <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> stupidity. "If it were merely a fine house richly furnished," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "I should not care about it myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the country."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> said no more—but <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> mind could not acquiesce. The possibility of meeting <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! <span class="transformed">He</span> blushed at the very idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span> than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections; and <span class="transformed">he</span> finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> private inquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered.<p></p><p></p>
Accordingly, when <span class="transformed">he</span> retired at night, <span class="transformed">he</span> asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">proprietress</span></span>? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question—and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> alarms now being removed, <span class="transformed">he</span> was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house <span class="transformed">himself</span>; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and <span class="transformed">he</span> was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper air of indifference, that <span class="transformed">he</span> had not really any dislike to the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Had Elizabeth's opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect, esteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of the country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her father's behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but respecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.<p></p><p></p>
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham's departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been looking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity—to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.<p></p><p></p>
"But it is fortunate," thought she, "that I have something to wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sister's absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation."<p></p><p></p>
When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to the camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still less to be learnt—for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words to be made public.<p></p><p></p>
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.<p></p><p></p>
The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent.

The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt's arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at Longbourn.

<p></p></article><div class="clear"></div><article class="left"><p></p><h1>Chapter 43</h1><p></p><p></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> spirits were in a high flutter.<p></p><p></p>
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a <span class="transformed">handsome</span> wood stretching over a wide extent.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s mind was too full for conversation, but <span class="transformed">he</span> saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was delighted. <span class="transformed">He</span> had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment <span class="transformed">he</span> felt that to be <span class="transformed">master</span> of Pemberley might be something!<p></p><p></p>
They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> apprehension of meeting its owner returned. <span class="transformed">He</span> dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> being where <span class="transformed">he</span> was.<p></p><p></p>
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly <span class="transformed">man</span>, much less fine, and more civil, than <span class="transformed">he</span> had any notion of finding <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. They followed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a <span class="transformed">handsome</span> object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and <span class="transformed">he</span> looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far as <span class="transformed">he</span> could trace it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">proprietress</span></span>; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> saw, with admiration of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.<p></p><p></p>
"And of this place," thought <span class="transformed">he</span>, "I might have been <span class="transformed">master</span>! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span>. But no,"—recollecting <span class="transformed">himself</span>—"that could never be; my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span> would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them."<p></p><p></p>
This was a lucky recollection—it saved <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> from something very like regret.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span> was really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question was asked by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>; and <span class="transformed">he</span> turned away with alarm, while <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Reynolds replied that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was, adding, "But we expect <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to-morrow, with a large party of friends." How rejoiced was <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span> now called <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to look at a picture. <span class="transformed">He</span> approached and saw the likeness of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span> asked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, smilingly, how <span class="transformed">he</span> liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>, the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span> of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> late <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span>'s <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">stewardess</span></span>, who had been brought up by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own expense. "<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is now gone into the army," <span class="transformed">he</span> added; "but I am afraid <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has turned out very wild."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner looked at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">nephew</span> with a smile, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could not return it.<p></p><p></p>
"And that," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span>—and very like <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. It was drawn at the same time as the other—about eight years ago."<p></p><p></p>
"I have heard much of your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span>'s fine person," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> face. But, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, you can tell us whether it is like or not."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Reynolds respect for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> seemed to increase on this intimation of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> knowing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"Does that young <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> know <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> coloured, and said: "A little."<p></p><p></p>
"And do not you think <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> a very <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>, ma'am?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, very <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"I am sure I know none so <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> than this. This room was my late <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span>'s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was very fond of them."<p></p><p></p>
This accounted to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> for <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham's being among them.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy, drawn when <span class="transformed">he</span> was only eight years old.<p></p><p></p>
"And is <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>?" said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! yes—the handsomest young <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> that ever was seen; and so accomplished!—<span class="transformed">He</span> plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a new instrument just come down for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>—a present from my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span>; <span class="transformed">he</span> comes here to-morrow with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> communicativeness by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> questions and remarks; <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"Is your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span> much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"<p></p><p></p>
"Not so much as I could wish, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>; but I dare say <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> may spend half <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> time here; and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy is always down for the summer months."<p></p><p></p>
"Except," thought <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "when <span class="transformed">he</span> goes to Ramsgate."<p></p><p></p>
"If your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span> would marry, you might see more of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who is good enough for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner smiled. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could not help saying, "It is very much to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> credit, I am sure, that you should think so."<p></p><p></p>
"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>," replied the other. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> thought this was going pretty far; and <span class="transformed">he</span> listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have never known a cross word from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in my life, and I have known <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> ever since <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was four years old."<p></p><p></p>
This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ideas. That <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was not a good-tempered <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> had been <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> firmest opinion. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> keenest attention was awakened; <span class="transformed">he</span> longed to hear more, and was grateful to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> for saying:<p></p><p></p>
"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in having such a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">girl</span></span> in the world."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> almost stared at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. "Can this be <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy?" thought <span class="transformed">he</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> was an excellent <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner.<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, ma'am, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was indeed; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span> will be just like <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>—just as affable to the poor."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Reynolds could interest <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> on no other point. <span class="transformed">He</span> related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> attributed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> excessive commendation of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span>, soon led again to the subject; and <span class="transformed">he</span> dwelt with energy on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is the best <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">landlady</span></span>, and the best <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span>," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "that ever lived; not like the wild young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span> nowadays, who think of nothing but themselves. There is not one of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> tenants or servants but will give <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> a good name. Some people call <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> does not rattle away like other young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"In what an amiable light does this place <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>!" thought <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"This fine account of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>," whispered <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span> as they walked, "is not quite consistent with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> behaviour to our poor friend."<p></p><p></p>
"Perhaps we might be deceived."<p></p><p></p>
"That is not very likely; our authority was too good."<p></p><p></p>
On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is certainly a good <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, as <span class="transformed">he</span> walked towards one of the windows.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Reynolds anticipated <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy's delight, when <span class="transformed">he</span> should enter the room. "And this is always the way with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>," <span class="transformed">he</span> added. "Whatever can give <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would not do for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>."<p></p><p></p>
The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, <span class="transformed">he</span> had willingly turned to look at some drawings of <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.<p></p><p></p>
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. At last it arrested <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>—and <span class="transformed">he</span> beheld a striking resemblance to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as <span class="transformed">he</span> remembered to have sometimes seen when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> looked at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s lifetime.<p></p><p></p>
There was certainly at this moment, in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original than <span class="transformed">he</span> had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> by <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">landlady</span></span>, a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> considered how many people's happiness were in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> guardianship!—how much of pleasure or pain was it in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> power to bestow!—how much of good or evil must be done by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> character, and as <span class="transformed">he</span> stood before the canvas on which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was represented, and fixed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> eyes upon <span class="transformed">himself</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> thought of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; <span class="transformed">he</span> remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.<p></p><p></p>
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.<p></p><p></p>
As they walked across the hall towards the river, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> turned back to look again; <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span> stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.<p></p><p></p>
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> appearance, that it was impossible to avoid <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> sight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, advanced towards the party, and spoke to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> had instinctively turned away; but stopping on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> approach, received <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> first appearance, or <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span>, must immediately have told it. They stood a little aloof while <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was talking to their <span class="transformed">nephew</span>, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> face, and knew not what answer <span class="transformed">he</span> returned to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> civil inquiries after <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family. Amazed at the alteration of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> manner since they last parted, every sentence that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> uttered was increasing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> being found there recurring to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> mind, the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> life. Nor did <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> seem much more at ease; when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> spoke, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> accent had none of its usual sedateness; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> repeated <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> inquiries as to the time of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> having left Longbourn, and of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> thoughts.<p></p><p></p>
At length every idea seemed to fail <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> suddenly recollected <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, and took leave.<p></p><p></p>
The others then joined <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and expressed admiration of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> figure; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own feelings, followed them in silence. <span class="transformed">He</span> was overpowered by shame and vexation. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must appear to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>! It might seem as if <span class="transformed">he</span> had purposely thrown <span class="transformed">himself</span> in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> way again! Oh! why did <span class="transformed">he</span> come? Or, why did <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> thus come a day before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> discrimination; for it was plain that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was that moment arrived—that moment alighted from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> horse or <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> carriage. <span class="transformed">He</span> blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> behaviour, so strikingly altered—what could it mean? That <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should even speak to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> was amazing!—but to speak with such civility, to inquire after <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family! Never in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> life had <span class="transformed">he</span> seen <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> manners so little dignified, never had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> last address in Rosings Park, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> put <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> letter into <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> hand! <span class="transformed">He</span> knew not what to think, or how to account for it.<p></p><p></p>
They had now entered a <span class="transformed">handsome</span> walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was sensible of any of it; and, though <span class="transformed">he</span> answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, and seemed to direct <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes to such objects as they pointed out, <span class="transformed">he</span> distinguished no part of the scene. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy then was. <span class="transformed">He</span> longed to know what at the moment was passing in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> mind—in what manner <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> thought of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and whether, in defiance of everything, <span class="transformed">he</span> was still dear to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. Perhaps <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been civil only because <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> felt <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> at ease; yet there had been that in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> voice which was not like ease. Whether <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">he</span> could not tell, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> certainly had not seen <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with composure.<p></p><p></p>
At length, however, the remarks of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> companions on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> absence of mind aroused <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and <span class="transformed">he</span> felt the necessity of appearing more like <span class="transformed">himself</span>.<p></p><p></p>
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed">nephew</span> was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> about them, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk here being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> before they met. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed, <span class="transformed">he</span> felt that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would probably strike into some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> from their view; the turning past, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was immediately before them. With a glance, <span class="transformed">he</span> saw that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had lost none of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> recent civility; and, to imitate <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> politeness, <span class="transformed">he</span> began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but <span class="transformed">he</span> had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and <span class="transformed">he</span> fancied that praise of Pemberley from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> might be mischievously construed. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> colour changed, and <span class="transformed">he</span> said no more.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> pausing, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> asked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> if <span class="transformed">he</span> would do <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> the honour of introducing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friends. This was a stroke of civility for which <span class="transformed">he</span> was quite unprepared; and <span class="transformed">he</span> could hardly suppress a smile at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> pride had revolted in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> offer to <span class="transformed">himself</span>. "What will be <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> surprise," thought <span class="transformed">he</span>, "when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> knows who they are? <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> takes them now for people of fashion."<p></p><p></p>
The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as <span class="transformed">he</span> named their relationship to <span class="transformed">himself</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> stole a sly look at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, to see how <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> bore it, and was not without the expectation of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> decamping as fast as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could from such disgraceful companions. That <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was surprised by the connection was evident; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should know <span class="transformed">he</span> had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. <span class="transformed">He</span> listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>, which marked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> intelligence, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> taste, or <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> good manners.<p></p><p></p>
The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and <span class="transformed">he</span> heard <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy invite <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> chose while <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, gave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> a look expressive of wonder. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> said nothing, but it gratified <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> exceedingly; the compliment must be all for <span class="transformed">himself</span>. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> astonishment, however, was extreme, and continually was <span class="transformed">he</span> repeating, "Why is <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for me—it cannot be for my sake that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this. It is impossible that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should still love me."<p></p><p></p>
After walking some time in this way, the two <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> in front, the two <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s arm inadequate to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> support, and consequently preferred <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>'s. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy took <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> place by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">nephew</span>, and they walked on together. After a short silence, the <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> first spoke. <span class="transformed">He</span> wished <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to know that <span class="transformed">he</span> had been assured of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> absence before <span class="transformed">he</span> came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> arrival had been very unexpected—"for your housekeeper," <span class="transformed">he</span> added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country." <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that business with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">stewardess</span></span> had occasioned <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been travelling. "They will join me early to-morrow," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> continued, "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you—<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span>."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> answered only by a slight bow. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's name had been the last mentioned between them; and, if <span class="transformed">he</span> might judge by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> complexion, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> mind was not very differently engaged.<p></p><p></p>
"There is also one other person in the party," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> continued after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my <span class="transformed">brother</span> to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?"<p></p><p></p>
The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to know in what manner <span class="transformed">he</span> acceded to it. <span class="transformed">He</span> immediately felt that whatever desire <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy might have of being acquainted with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> must be the work of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, and, without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> resentment had not made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> think really ill of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was not comfortable; that was impossible; but <span class="transformed">he</span> was flattered and pleased. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> wish of introducing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> then asked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to walk into the house—but <span class="transformed">he</span> declared <span class="transformed">himself</span> not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. <span class="transformed">He</span> wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last <span class="transformed">he</span> recollected that <span class="transformed">he</span> had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance. Yet time and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span> moved slowly—and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> patience and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was over. On <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy handed the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> into the carriage; and when it drove off, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> saw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> walking slowly towards the house.<p></p><p></p>
The observations of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span> now began; and each of them pronounced <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected. "<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"There is something a little stately in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, to be sure," replied <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, "but it is confined to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> air, and is not unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> proud, I have seen nothing of it."<p></p><p></p>
"I was never more surprised than by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> behaviour to us. It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> acquaintance with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was very trifling."<p></p><p></p>
"To be sure, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, "<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is not so <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> as Wickham; or, rather, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has not Wickham's countenance, for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was so disagreeable?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> excused <span class="transformed">himself</span> as well as <span class="transformed">he</span> could; said that <span class="transformed">he</span> had liked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> better when they had met in Kent than before, and that <span class="transformed">he</span> had never seen <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> so pleasant as this morning.<p></p><p></p>
"But perhaps <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> may be a little whimsical in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> civilities," replied <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>. "Your great <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span> often are; and therefore I shall not take <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> word, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might change <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> mind another day, and warn me off <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> grounds."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> felt that they had entirely misunderstood <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> character, but said nothing.<p></p><p></p>
"From what we have seen of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>," continued <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, "I really should not have thought that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has done by poor Wickham. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> mouth when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> speaks. And there is something of dignity in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> heart. But, to be sure, the good <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> who showed us <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> house did give <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is a liberal <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span>, I suppose, and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> here felt <span class="transformed">himself</span> called on to say something in vindication of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as <span class="transformed">he</span> could, that by what <span class="transformed">he</span> had heard from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> relations in Kent, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> actions were capable of a very different construction; and that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, <span class="transformed">he</span> related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and <span class="transformed">he</span> was too much engaged in pointing out to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as <span class="transformed">he</span> had been by the morning's walk they had no sooner dined than <span class="transformed">he</span> set off again in quest of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.<p></p><p></p>
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> much attention for any of these new friends; and <span class="transformed">he</span> could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's civility, and, above all, of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> wishing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to be acquainted with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.<p></p><p></p>
The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth's mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!<p></p><p></p>
They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was.<p></p><p></p>
The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.<p></p><p></p>
"And of this place," thought she, "I might have been mistress! With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,"—recollecting herself—"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been allowed to invite them."<p></p><p></p>
This was a lucky recollection—it saved her from something very like regret.<p></p><p></p>
She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he was, adding, "But we expect him to-morrow, with a large party of friends." How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!<p></p><p></p>
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expense. "He is now gone into the army," she added; "but I am afraid he has turned out very wild."<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it.<p></p><p></p>
"And that," said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures, "is my master—and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the other—about eight years ago."<p></p><p></p>
"I have heard much of your master's fine person," said Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not."<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.<p></p><p></p>
"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?"<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth coloured, and said: "A little."<p></p><p></p>
"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, very handsome."<p></p><p></p>
"I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late master's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of them."<p></p><p></p>
This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.<p></p><p></p>
"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?" said Mrs. Gardiner.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!—She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her—a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister.<p></p><p></p>
"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"<p></p><p></p>
"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months."<p></p><p></p>
"Except," thought Elizabeth, "when she goes to Ramsgate."<p></p><p></p>
"If your master would marry, you might see more of him."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, sir; but I do not know when that will be. I do not know who is good enough for him."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, "It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."<p></p><p></p>
"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him," replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, "I have never known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever since he was four years old."<p></p><p></p>
This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion. Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying:<p></p><p></p>
"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in having such a master."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the world."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth almost stared at her. "Can this be Mr. Darcy?" thought she.<p></p><p></p>
"His father was an excellent man," said Mrs. Gardiner.<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him—just as affable to the poor."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.<p></p><p></p>
"He is the best landlord, and the best master," said she, "that ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men."<p></p><p></p>
"In what an amiable light does this place him!" thought Elizabeth.<p></p><p></p>
"This fine account of him," whispered her aunt as they walked, "is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."<p></p><p></p>
"Perhaps we might be deceived."<p></p><p></p>
"That is not very likely; our authority was too good."<p></p><p></p>
On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley.<p></p><p></p>
"He is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room. "And this is always the way with him," she added. "Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There is nothing he would not do for her."<p></p><p></p>
The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.<p></p><p></p>
In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested her—and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father's lifetime.<p></p><p></p>
There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she considered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship!—how much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!—how much of good or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.<p></p><p></p>
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.<p></p><p></p>
As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.<p></p><p></p>
They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.<p></p><p></p>
She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach, received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts.<p></p><p></p>
At length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took leave.<p></p><p></p>
The others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived—that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly altered—what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was amazing!—but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account for it.<p></p><p></p>
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind—in what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything, she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease; yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with composure.<p></p><p></p>
At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.<p></p><p></p>
They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was, therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk here being here less sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed, she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words "delightful," and "charming," when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said no more.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself. "What will be his surprise," thought she, "when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of fashion."<p></p><p></p>
The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. That he was surprised by the connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.<p></p><p></p>
The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and continually was she repeating, "Why is he so altered? From what can it proceed? It cannot be for me—it cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love me."<p></p><p></p>
After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found Elizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred her husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected—"for your housekeeper," she added, "informed us that you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country." He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. "They will join me early to-morrow," he continued, "and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you—Mr. Bingley and his sisters."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been the last mentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, his mind was not very differently engaged.<p></p><p></p>
"There is also one other person in the party," he continued after a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?"<p></p><p></p>
The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her.<p></p><p></p>
They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.<p></p><p></p>
He then asked her to walk into the house—but she declared herself not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly—and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was over. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house.<p></p><p></p>
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected. "He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming," said her uncle.<p></p><p></p>
"There is something a little stately in him, to be sure," replied her aunt, "but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I have seen nothing of it."<p></p><p></p>
"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling."<p></p><p></p>
"To be sure, Lizzy," said her aunt, "he is not so handsome as Wickham; or, rather, he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?"<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning.<p></p><p></p>
"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities," replied her uncle. "Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but said nothing.<p></p><p></p>
"From what we have seen of him," continued Mrs. Gardiner, "I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a intercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.<p></p><p></p>
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had settled it that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy would bring <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> to visit <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> the very day after <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> and a <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> in a curricle driving up the street. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> surprise to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> relations by acquainting them with the honour which <span class="transformed">he</span> expected. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span> were all amazement; and the embarrassment of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> manner as <span class="transformed">he</span> spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their <span class="transformed">nephew</span>. While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s feelings was at every moment increasing. <span class="transformed">He</span> was quite amazed at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, <span class="transformed">he</span> dreaded lest the partiality of the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> should have said too much in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, <span class="transformed">he</span> naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as <span class="transformed">he</span> walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose <span class="transformed">himself</span>, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span> as made everything worse.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> appeared, and this formidable introduction took place. With astonishment did <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> see that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as <span class="transformed">himself</span>. Since <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> being at Lambton, <span class="transformed">he</span> had heard that <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that <span class="transformed">he</span> was only exceedingly shy. <span class="transformed">He</span> found it difficult to obtain even a word from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> beyond a monosyllable.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; and, though little more than sixteen, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> figure was formed, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> appearance womanly and graceful. <span class="transformed">He</span> was less <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> than <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>; but there was sense and good humour in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> face, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, who had expected to find in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.<p></p><p></p>
They had not long been together before <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy told <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that Bingley was also coming to wait on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; and <span class="transformed">he</span> had barely time to express <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> entered the room. All <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s anger against <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> had been long done away; but had <span class="transformed">he</span> still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> expressed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> on seeing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> again. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> inquired in a friendly, though general way, after <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had ever done.<p></p><p></p>
To <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was scarcely a less interesting personage than to <span class="transformed">himself</span>. They had long wished to see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just arisen of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy and their <span class="transformed">nephew</span> directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of the <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>'s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> side, had much to do. <span class="transformed">He</span> wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> visitors; <span class="transformed">he</span> wanted to compose <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own, and to make <span class="transformed">himself</span> agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where <span class="transformed">he</span> feared most to fail, <span class="transformed">he</span> was most sure of success, for those to whom <span class="transformed">he</span> endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.<p></p><p></p>
In seeing Bingley, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> thoughts naturally flew to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>; and, oh! how ardently did <span class="transformed">he</span> long to know whether any of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> were directed in a like manner. Sometimes <span class="transformed">he</span> could fancy that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased <span class="transformed">himself</span> with the notion that, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> looked at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not be deceived as to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> behaviour to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>. On this point <span class="transformed">he</span> was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> dared. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> observed to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had had the pleasure of seeing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>;" and, before <span class="transformed">he</span> could reply, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> added, "It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was pleased to find <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> memory so exact; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> afterwards took occasion to ask <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.<p></p><p></p>
It was not often that <span class="transformed">he</span> could turn <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes on <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>; but, whenever <span class="transformed">he</span> did catch a glimpse, <span class="transformed">he</span> saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> said <span class="transformed">he</span> heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> companions, as convinced <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that the improvement of manners which <span class="transformed">he</span> had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When <span class="transformed">he</span> saw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace—when <span class="transformed">he</span> saw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> thus civil, not only to <span class="transformed">himself</span>, but to the very relations whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage—the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> mind, that <span class="transformed">he</span> could hardly restrain <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> dear friends at Netherfield, or <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> dignified relations at Rosings, had <span class="transformed">he</span> seen <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> both of Netherfield and Rosings.<p></p><p></p>
Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose to depart, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy called on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> to join <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in expressing their wish of seeing <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner looked at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">nephew</span>, desirous of knowing how <span class="transformed">he</span>, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had turned away <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> head. Presuming however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, <span class="transformed">he</span> ventured to engage for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.<p></p><p></p>
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> again, having still a great deal to say to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, construing all this into a wish of hearing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> speak of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found <span class="transformed">himself</span>, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.<p></p><p></p>
But <span class="transformed">he</span> had no reason to fear <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> communication. It was evident that <span class="transformed">he</span> was much better acquainted with <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was very much in love with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.<p></p><p></p>
Of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> politeness; and had they drawn <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> character from their own feelings and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was known would not have recognized it for <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> since <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had nothing to accuse <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> of but pride; pride <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was a liberal <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, and did much good among the poor.<p></p><p></p>
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> concerns with the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span> of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> quitting Derbyshire, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had left many debts behind <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, which <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy afterwards discharged.<p></p><p></p>
As for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feelings towards one in that mansion; and <span class="transformed">he</span> lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. <span class="transformed">He</span> certainly did not hate <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and <span class="transformed">he</span> had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> favour, and bringing forward <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> of goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, but for loving <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> manner in rejecting <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and all the unjust accusations accompanying <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> rejection. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> who, <span class="transformed">he</span> had been persuaded, would avoid <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friends, and bent on making <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> known to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>. Such a change in a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. <span class="transformed">He</span> respected, <span class="transformed">he</span> esteemed, <span class="transformed">he</span> was grateful to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> felt a real interest in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> welfare; and <span class="transformed">he</span> only wanted to know how far <span class="transformed">he</span> wished that welfare to depend upon <span class="transformed">himself</span>, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that <span class="transformed">he</span> should employ the power, which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> fancy told <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">he</span> still possessed, of bringing on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> the renewal of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> addresses.<p></p><p></p>
It had been settled in the evening between the <span class="transformed">uncle</span> and the <span class="transformed">nephew</span>, that such a striking civility as <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy's in coming to see them on the very day of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> arrival at Pemberley, for <span class="transformed">he</span> had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> at Pemberley the following morning. They were, therefore, to go. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was pleased; though when <span class="transformed">he</span> asked <span class="transformed">himself</span> the reason, <span class="transformed">he</span> had very little to say in reply.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> meeting some of the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> at Pemberley before noon.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of Elizabeth's feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite amazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet, she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.<p></p><p></p>
She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.<p></p><p></p>
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable.<p></p><p></p>
Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there was sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such different feelings.<p></p><p></p>
They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All Elizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but had she still felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He inquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.<p></p><p></p>
To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.<p></p><p></p>
In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh! how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it "was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;" and, before she could reply, he added, "It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether all her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.<p></p><p></p>
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general complaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace—when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage—the difference, the change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.<p></p><p></p>
Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing how she, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.<p></p><p></p>
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.<p></p><p></p>
But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.<p></p><p></p>
Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant's report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.<p></p><p></p>
With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.<p></p><p></p>
As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him, that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses.<p></p><p></p>
It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy's in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.<p></p><p></p>

Convinced as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> now was that <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley's dislike of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> had originated in jealousy, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not help feeling how unwelcome <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> appearance at Pemberley must be to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and was curious to know with how much civility on that <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>'s side the acquaintance would now be renewed.<p></p><p></p>
On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the <span class="transformed">handsome</span> oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.<p></p><p></p>
In this house they were received by <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy, who was sitting there with <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley, and the <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> with whom <span class="transformed">he</span> lived in London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> being proud and reserved. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">nephew</span>, however, did <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> justice, and pitied <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
By <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hurst and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking <span class="transformed">man</span>, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, with occasional help from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, the conversation was carried on. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy looked as if <span class="transformed">he</span> wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> soon saw that <span class="transformed">he</span> was <span class="transformed">himself</span> closely watched by <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley, and that <span class="transformed">he</span> could not speak a word, especially to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy, without calling <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> attention. This observation would not have prevented <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but <span class="transformed">he</span> was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> own thoughts were employing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> expected every moment that some of the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> would enter the room. <span class="transformed">He</span> wished, <span class="transformed">he</span> feared that the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span> of the house might be amongst them; and whether <span class="transformed">he</span> wished or feared it most, <span class="transformed">he</span> could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley's voice, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was roused by receiving from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> a cold inquiry after the health of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family. <span class="transformed">He</span> answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.<p></p><p></p>
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Annesley to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy had been given, to remind <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> post. There was now employment for the whole party—for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the <span class="transformed">handsome</span> pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.<p></p><p></p>
While thus engaged, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had a fair opportunity of deciding whether <span class="transformed">he</span> most feared or wished for the appearance of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> entering the room; and then, though but a moment before <span class="transformed">he</span> had believed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> wishes to predominate, <span class="transformed">he</span> began to regret that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> came.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had been some time with <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner, who, with two or three other <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> only on learning that the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> appear than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because <span class="transformed">he</span> saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> behaviour when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> face whenever <span class="transformed">he</span> spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> desperate, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> attentions to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy were by no means over. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy, on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>'s entrance, exerted <span class="transformed">himself</span> much more to talk, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> saw that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was anxious for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> and <span class="transformed">himself</span> to get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:<p></p><p></p>
"Pray, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Eliza, are not the ——shire Militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to your family."<p></p><p></p>
In Darcy's presence <span class="transformed">he</span> dared not mention Wickham's name; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> instantly comprehended that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was uppermost in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> thoughts; and the various recollections connected with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> gave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> a moment's distress; but exerting <span class="transformed">himself</span> vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, <span class="transformed">he</span> presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While <span class="transformed">he</span> spoke, an involuntary glance showed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes. Had <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley known what pain <span class="transformed">he</span> was then giving <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> beloved friend, <span class="transformed">he</span> undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but <span class="transformed">he</span> had merely intended to discompose <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> by bringing forward the idea of a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> to whom <span class="transformed">he</span> believed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> partial, to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> betray a sensibility which might injure <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> of <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy's meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; and from all Bingley's connections <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had long ago attributed to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, of their becoming hereafter <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> endeavour to separate <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> from <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> lively concern for the welfare of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> emotion; and as <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, whose eye <span class="transformed">he</span> feared to meet, scarcely recollected <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> thoughts from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> seemed to have fixed them on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> more and more cheerfully.<p></p><p></p>
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy was attending them to their carriage <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley was venting <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feelings in criticisms on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>'s recommendation was enough to ensure <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> favour; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> judgement could not err. And <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had spoken in such terms of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley could not help repeating to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> some part of what <span class="transformed">he</span> had been saying to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"How very ill <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Eliza Bennet looks this morning, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy," <span class="transformed">he</span> cried; "I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as <span class="transformed">he</span> is since the winter. <span class="transformed">He</span> is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> again."<p></p><p></p>
However little <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy might have liked such an address, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> contented <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> with coolly replying that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> perceived no other alteration than <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.<p></p><p></p>
"For my own part," <span class="transformed">he</span> rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see any beauty in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> face is too thin; <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> complexion has no brilliancy; and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> features are not at all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> nose wants character—there is nothing marked in its lines. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable."<p></p><p></p>
Persuaded as <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley was that Darcy admired <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, this was not the best method of recommending <span class="transformed">himself</span>; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at last look somewhat nettled, <span class="transformed">he</span> had all the success <span class="transformed">he</span> expected. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was resolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> speak, <span class="transformed">he</span> continued:<p></p><p></p>
"I remember, when we first knew <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that <span class="transformed">he</span> was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '<span class="transformed">He</span> a beauty!—I should as soon call <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> a wit.' But afterwards <span class="transformed">he</span> seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> rather pretty at one time."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> no longer, "but that was only when I first saw <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, for it is many months since I have considered <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> as one of the handsomest <span class="transformed">men</span> of my acquaintance."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> then went away, and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to say what gave no one any pain but <span class="transformed">himself</span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friends, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> house, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> fruit—of everything but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>; yet <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was longing to know what <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner thought of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">nephew</span>'s beginning the subject.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley's dislike of her had originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady's side the acquaintance would now be renewed.<p></p><p></p>
On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.<p></p><p></p>
In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in London. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.<p></p><p></p>
By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley, and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.<p></p><p></p>
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole party—for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.<p></p><p></p>
While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to regret that he came.<p></p><p></p>
He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:<p></p><p></p>
"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ——shire Militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to your family."<p></p><p></p>
In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.<p></p><p></p>
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth's person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.<p></p><p></p>
"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy," she cried; "I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again."<p></p><p></p>
However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.<p></p><p></p>
"For my own part," she rejoined, "I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants character—there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable."<p></p><p></p>
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued:<p></p><p></p>
"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, 'She a beauty!—I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes," replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, "but that was only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."<p></p><p></p>
He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit—of everything but himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece's beginning the subject.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> repining was over, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> justified, by the receipt of two letters from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was not surprised at it, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had written the direction remarkably ill.<p></p><p></p>
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, leaving <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:<p></p><p></p>
"Since writing the above, dearest <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you—be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that <span class="transformed">he</span> was gone off to Scotland with one of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to hope the best, and that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> choice is disinterested at least, for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must know my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> can give <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> nothing. Our poor <span class="transformed">father</span> is sadly grieved. My <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> here soon. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> left a few lines for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>, informing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor <span class="transformed">father</span>. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written."<p></p><p></p>
Without allowing <span class="transformed">himself</span> time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what <span class="transformed">he</span> felt, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> on finishing this letter instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.<p></p><p></p>
"By this time, my dearest <span class="transformed">brother</span>, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham and our poor <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s short letter to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success—no such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> came on to Longbourn, and broke <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> heart. I am sincerely grieved for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, is very great. My <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> and <span class="transformed">father</span> believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could form such a design against a young <span class="transformed">man</span> of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> shook <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> head when I expressed my hopes, and said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> feared W. was not a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> to be trusted. My poor <span class="transformed">father</span> is really ill, and keeps <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> room. Could <span class="transformed">he</span> exert <span class="transformed">himself</span>, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And as to my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, I never in my life saw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> so affected. Poor <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span> so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former. My <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. What <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> means to do I am sure I know not; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> excessive distress will not allow <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>'s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> goodness."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! where, where is my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>?" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, darting from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> seat as <span class="transformed">he</span> finished the letter, in eagerness to follow <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as <span class="transformed">he</span> reached the door it was opened by a servant, and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy appeared. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> pale face and impetuous manner made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> start, and before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could recover <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> to speak, <span class="transformed">he</span>, in whose mind every idea was superseded by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose."<p></p><p></p>
"Good <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Goddess</span></span>! what is the matter?" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, "I will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> hesitated, but <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> knees trembled under <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> and <span class="transformed">he</span> felt how little would be gained by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> attempting to pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, <span class="transformed">he</span> commissioned <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, though in so breathless an accent as made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> almost unintelligible, to fetch <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span> and <span class="transformed">master</span> home instantly.<p></p><p></p>
On <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> quitting the room <span class="transformed">he</span> sat down, unable to support <span class="transformed">himself</span>, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, "Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill."<p></p><p></p>
"No, I thank you," <span class="transformed">he</span> replied, endeavouring to recover <span class="transformed">himself</span>. "There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> burst into tears as <span class="transformed">he</span> alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> concern, and observe <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in compassionate silence. At length <span class="transformed">he</span> spoke again. "I have just had a letter from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger <span class="transformed">brother</span> has left all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friends—has eloped; has thrown <span class="transformed">himself</span> into the power of—of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. You know <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> too well to doubt the rest. <span class="transformed">He</span> has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to—<span class="transformed">he</span> is lost for ever."<p></p><p></p>
Darcy was fixed in astonishment. "When I consider," <span class="transformed">he</span> added in a yet more agitated voice, "that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was. Had I but explained some part of it only—some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all—all too late now."<p></p><p></p>
"I am grieved indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved—shocked. But is it certain—absolutely certain?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland."<p></p><p></p>
"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"My <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> is gone to London, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> has written to beg my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>'s immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But nothing can be done—I know very well that nothing can be done. How is such a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!"<p></p><p></p>
Darcy shook <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> head in silent acquiescence.<p></p><p></p>
"When my eyes were opened to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> real character—Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not—I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!"<p></p><p></p>
Darcy made no answer. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> seemed scarcely to hear <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> brow contracted, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> air gloomy. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> soon observed, and instantly understood it. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> power was sinking; everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. <span class="transformed">He</span> could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> bosom, afforded no palliation of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> understand <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own wishes; and never had <span class="transformed">he</span> so honestly felt that <span class="transformed">he</span> could have loved <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, as now, when all love must be vain.<p></p><p></p>
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>—the humiliation, the misery <span class="transformed">he</span> was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> face with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> handkerchief, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> situation by the voice of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy. Say that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> readily assured <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> secrecy; again expressed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> sorrow for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> compliments for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.<p></p><p></p>
As <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> quitted the room, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as <span class="transformed">he</span> threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.<p></p><p></p>
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise—if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> defence, except that <span class="transformed">he</span> had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> partiality for Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, <span class="transformed">he</span> saw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> go with regret; and in this early example of what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as <span class="transformed">he</span> reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s second letter, had <span class="transformed">he</span> entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. No one but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> thought, could flatter <span class="transformed">himself</span> with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> mind, <span class="transformed">he</span> was all surprise—all astonishment that Wickham should marry a <span class="transformed">boy</span> whom it was impossible <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could marry for money; and how <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> could ever have attached <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this <span class="transformed">he</span> might have sufficient charms; and though <span class="transformed">he</span> did not suppose <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, <span class="transformed">he</span> had no difficulty in believing that neither <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> virtue nor <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> understanding would preserve <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> from falling an easy prey.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> had any partiality for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; but <span class="transformed">he</span> was convinced that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> wanted only encouragement to attach <span class="transformed">himself</span> to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> favourite, as their attentions raised them in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> opinion. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a <span class="transformed">boy</span>—oh! how acutely did <span class="transformed">he</span> now feel it!<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to share with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> in the cares that must now fall wholly upon <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, in a family so deranged, a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> absent, a <span class="transformed">father</span> incapable of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>'s interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> entered the room <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> impatience was severe. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's account that their <span class="transformed">nephew</span> was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that head, <span class="transformed">he</span> eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy.— Though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> had never been a favourite with them, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted. Not <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner promised every assistance in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> power. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, though expecting no less, thanked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. "But what is to be done about Pemberley?" cried <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner. "John told us <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes; and I told <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> we should not be able to keep our engagement. That is all settled."<p></p><p></p>
"What is all settled?" repeated the other, as <span class="transformed">he</span> ran into <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> room to prepare. "And are they upon such terms as for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!"<p></p><p></p>
But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> been at leisure to be idle, <span class="transformed">he</span> would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as <span class="transformed">himself</span>; but <span class="transformed">he</span> had <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> share of business as well as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner meanwhile having settled <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, after all the misery of the morning, found <span class="transformed">himself</span>, in a shorter space of time than <span class="transformed">he</span> could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.<p></p><p></p>
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:<p></p><p></p>
"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you—be assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood. Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly know what I have written."<p></p><p></p>
Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing what she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.<p></p><p></p>
"By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success—no such people had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my uncle's advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose."<p></p><p></p>
"Good God! what is the matter?" cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and mistress home instantly.<p></p><p></p>
On his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration, "Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill."<p></p><p></p>
"No, I thank you," she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. "There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn."<p></p><p></p>
She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say something indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke again. "I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her friends—has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of—of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. You know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to—she is lost for ever."<p></p><p></p>
Darcy was fixed in astonishment. "When I consider," she added in a yet more agitated voice, "that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what he was. Had I but explained some part of it only—some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all—all too late now."<p></p><p></p>
"I am grieved indeed," cried Darcy; "grieved—shocked. But is it certain—absolutely certain?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland."<p></p><p></p>
"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"<p></p><p></p>
"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But nothing can be done—I know very well that nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!"<p></p><p></p>
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.<p></p><p></p>
"When my eyes were opened to his real character—Oh! had I known what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not—I was afraid of doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!"<p></p><p></p>
Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power was sinking; everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither wonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him, as now, when all love must be vain.<p></p><p></p>
But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia—the humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be long."<p></p><p></p>
He readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.<p></p><p></p>
As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination.<p></p><p></p>
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise—if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise—all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.<p></p><p></p>

Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant's account that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy.— Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted.

"I have been thinking it over again, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest <span class="transformed">brother</span> does on the matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> should form such a design against a <span class="transformed">boy</span> who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> expect that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friends would not step forward? Could <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> temptation is not adequate to the risk!"<p></p><p></p>
"Do you really think so?" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, brightening up for a moment.<p></p><p></p>
"Upon my word," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, "I begin to be of your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>'s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, so wholly give <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> up, as to believe <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> capable of it?"<p></p><p></p>
"Not, perhaps, of neglecting <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own interest; but of every other neglect I can believe <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case?"<p></p><p></p>
"In the first place," replied <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road."<p></p><p></p>
"Well, then—supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland."<p></p><p></p>
"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no—this is not likely. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> most particular friend, you see by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s account, was persuaded of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> never intending to marry <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. Wickham will never marry a <span class="transformed">man</span> without some money. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> cannot afford it. And what claims has <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>—what attraction has <span class="transformed">he</span> beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> sake, forego every chance of benefiting <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> has no <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sisters</span></span> to step forward; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might imagine, from my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s behaviour, from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> indolence and the little attention <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> family, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would do as little, and think as little about it, as any <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> could do, in such a matter."<p></p><p></p>
"But can you think that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> is so lost to everything but love of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> as to consent to live with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> on any terms other than marriage?"<p></p><p></p>
"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, with tears in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes, "that a <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> justice. But <span class="transformed">he</span> is very young; <span class="transformed">he</span> has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a twelvemonth—<span class="transformed">he</span> has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. <span class="transformed">He</span> has been allowed to dispose of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> way. Since the ——shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> head. <span class="transformed">He</span> has been doing everything in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater—what shall I call it? susceptibility to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a <span class="transformed">man</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"But you see that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, "does not think so very ill of Wickham as to believe <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> capable of the attempt."<p></p><p></p>
"Of whom does <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that <span class="transformed">he</span> would think capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has been profligate in every sense of the word; that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has neither integrity nor honour; that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is as false and deceitful as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is insinuating."<p></p><p></p>
"And do you really know all this?" cried <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> intelligence was all alive.<p></p><p></p>
"I do indeed," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, colouring. "I told you, the other day, of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> infamous behaviour to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> spoke of the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty—which it is not worth while to relate; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> said of <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable <span class="transformed">boy</span>. Yet <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> knew to the contrary <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> must know that <span class="transformed">he</span> was as amiable and unpretending as we have found <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"But does <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> know nothing of this? can <span class="transformed">he</span> be ignorant of what you and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> seem so well to understand?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, yes!—that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> relation Colonel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Wilhelmina</span></span>, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ——shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the case, neither <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> should go with <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Forster, the necessity of opening <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> character never occurred to me. That <span class="transformed">he</span> could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a consequence as this could ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts."<p></p><p></p>
"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?"<p></p><p></p>
"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> entered the corps, <span class="transformed">he</span> was ready enough to admire <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; but so we all were. Every <span class="transformed">boy</span> in or near Meryton was out of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> senses about <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> for the first two months; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> never distinguished <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> by any particular attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> fancy for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with more distinction, again became <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> favourites."<p></p><p></p>
It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, <span class="transformed">he</span> could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.<p></p><p></p>
They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a comfort to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> to consider that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> could not have been wearied by long expectations.<p></p><p></p>
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, who came running down from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>'s apartment, immediately met <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, as <span class="transformed">he</span> affectionately embraced <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives.<p></p><p></p>
"Not yet," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>. "But now that my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> is come, I hope everything will be well."<p></p><p></p>
"Is my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> in town?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word."<p></p><p></p>
"And have you heard from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> often?"<p></p><p></p>
"We have heard only twice. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had arrived in safety, and to give me <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> directions, which I particularly begged <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to do. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> merely added that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should not write again till <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had something of importance to mention."<p></p><p></p>
"And my <span class="transformed">father</span>—how is <span class="transformed">he</span>? How are you all?"<p></p><p></p>
"My <span class="transformed">father</span> is tolerably well, I trust; though <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> spirits are greatly shaken. <span class="transformed">He</span> is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. <span class="transformed">He</span> does not yet leave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> dressing-room. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, thank Heaven, are quite well."<p></p><p></p>
"But you—how are you?" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>. "You look pale. How much you must have gone through!"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, however, assured <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> ran to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.<p></p><p></p>
When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> heart suggested had not yet deserted <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; <span class="transformed">he</span> still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> or <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes' conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span> must principally be owing.<p></p><p></p>
"If I had been able," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "to carry my point in going to Brighton, with all my family, this would not have happened; but poor dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> had nobody to take care of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. Why did the Forsters ever let <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for <span class="transformed">he</span> is not the kind of <span class="transformed">boy</span> to do such a thing if <span class="transformed">he</span> had been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And now here's <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet gone away, and I know <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will fight Wickham, wherever <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> meets <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> and then <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is cold in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> grave, and if you are not kind to us, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, I do not know what we shall do."<p></p><p></p>
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner, after general assurances of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> affection for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> and all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family, told <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"Do not give way to useless alarm," added <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>; "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, and make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>," replied <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, "that is exactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> <span class="transformed">he</span> shall have as much money as <span class="transformed">he</span> chooses to buy them, after they are married. And, above all, keep <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet from fighting. Tell <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my wits—and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me—such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> not to give any directions about <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> clothes till <span class="transformed">he</span> has seen me, for <span class="transformed">he</span> does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all."<p></p><p></p>
But <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner, though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> assured <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> again of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, as well in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> hopes as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> fear; and after talking with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to vent all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">sons</span>.<p></p><p></p>
Though <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> and <span class="transformed">brother</span> were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that <span class="transformed">he</span> had not prudence enough to hold <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that one only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> fears and solicitude on the subject.<p></p><p></p>
In the dining-room they were soon joined by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before. One came from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> books, and the other from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> favourite <span class="transformed">brother</span>, or the anger which <span class="transformed">he</span> had <span class="transformed">himself</span> incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>. As for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> was <span class="transformed">master</span> enough of <span class="transformed">himself</span> to whisper to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:<p></p><p></p>
"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation."<p></p><p></p>
Then, perceiving in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> no inclination of replying, <span class="transformed">he</span> added, "Unhappy as the event must be for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, we may draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a <span class="transformed">male</span> is irretrievable; that one false step involves <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> in endless ruin; that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> reputation is no less brittle than it is <span class="transformed">handsome</span>; and that <span class="transformed">he</span> cannot be too much guarded in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> lifted up <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span>, however, continued to console <span class="transformed">himself</span> with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.<p></p><p></p>
In the afternoon, the two elder <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennets were able to be for half-an-hour by themselves; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> instantly availed <span class="transformed">himself</span> of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> considered as all but certain, and <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever."<p></p><p></p>
"Colonel Forster did own that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had often suspected some partiality, especially on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s side, but nothing to give <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> any alarm. I am so grieved for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was coming to us, in order to assure us of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> concern, before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> journey."<p></p><p></p>
"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes; but, when questioned by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, Denny denied knowing anything of their plans, and would not give <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> real opinion about it. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> did not repeat <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> persuasion of their not marrying—and from that, I am inclined to hope, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might have been misunderstood before."<p></p><p></p>
"And till Colonel Forster came <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"<p></p><p></p>
"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a little uneasy—a little fearful of my <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s happiness with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in marriage, because I knew that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> conduct had not been always quite right. My <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> and <span class="transformed">father</span> knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s last letter <span class="transformed">he</span> had prepared <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for such a step. <span class="transformed">He</span> had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks."<p></p><p></p>
"But not before they went to Brighton?"<p></p><p></p>
"No, I believe not."<p></p><p></p>
"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>? Does <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> know <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> real character?"<p></p><p></p>
"I must confess that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did not speak so well of Wickham as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> formerly did. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> believed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, this could not have happened!"<p></p><p></p>
"Perhaps it would have been better," replied <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>. "But to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions."<p></p><p></p>
"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s note to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> brought it with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> for us to see."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> then took it from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> pocket-book, and gave it to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>. These were the contents:<p></p><p></p>
"MY DEAR HARRIET,<p></p><p></p>
"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> in the world I love, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is an angel. I should never be happy without <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign my name '<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> Wickham.' What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to-night. Tell <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> I hope <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will excuse me when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> knows all; and tell <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> I will dance with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey.<p></p><p></p>
"Your affectionate friend,<p></p><p></p>
"LYDIA BENNET."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>!" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> when <span class="transformed">he</span> had finished it. "What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But at least it shows that <span class="transformed">he</span> was serious on the subject of their journey. Whatever <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might afterwards persuade <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to, it was not on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> side a scheme of infamy. My poor <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>! how <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must have felt it!"<p></p><p></p>
"I never saw anyone so shocked. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> could not speak a word for full ten minutes. My <span class="transformed">father</span> was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"<p></p><p></p>
"I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult. My <span class="transformed">father</span> was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties."<p></p><p></p>
"Your attendance upon <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> has been too much for you. You do not look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> is slight and delicate; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> studies so much, that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> hours of repose should not be broken in on. My <span class="transformed">uncle</span> Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. <span class="transformed">He</span> was of great use and comfort to us all. And <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span> has been very kind; <span class="transformed">he</span> walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> services, or any of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">sons</span>', if they should be of use to us."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">He</span> had better have stayed at home," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; "perhaps <span class="transformed">he</span> meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> then proceeded to inquire into the measures which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">son</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> meant I believe," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, "to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> thought that the circumstance of a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> and <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>'s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> fare, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other designs that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had formed; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was in such a hurry to be gone, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this."<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth," said her uncle, as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is not adequate to the risk!"<p></p><p></p>
"Do you really think so?" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.<p></p><p></p>
"Upon my word," said Mrs. Gardiner, "I begin to be of your uncle's opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and interest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?"<p></p><p></p>
"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other neglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case?"<p></p><p></p>
"In the first place," replied Mr. Gardiner, "there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road."<p></p><p></p>
"Well, then—supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland."<p></p><p></p>
"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no—this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia—what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that he would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter."<p></p><p></p>
"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?"<p></p><p></p>
"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed," replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, "that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a twelvemonth—she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way. Since the ——shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give greater—what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman."<p></p><p></p>
"But you see that Jane," said her aunt, "does not think so very ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt."<p></p><p></p>
"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be their former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating."<p></p><p></p>
"And do you really know all this?" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.<p></p><p></p>
"I do indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring. "I told you, the other day, of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty—which it is not worth while to relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her."<p></p><p></p>
"But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, yes!—that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ——shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight's time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a consequence as this could ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts."<p></p><p></p>
"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?"<p></p><p></p>
"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months; but he never distinguished her by any particular attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment, who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites."<p></p><p></p>
It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.<p></p><p></p>
They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations.<p></p><p></p>
The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her mother's apartment, immediately met her.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been heard of the fugitives.<p></p><p></p>
"Not yet," replied Jane. "But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope everything will be well."<p></p><p></p>
"Is my father in town?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word."<p></p><p></p>
"And have you heard from him often?"<p></p><p></p>
"We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I particularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention."<p></p><p></p>
"And my mother—how is she? How are you all?"<p></p><p></p>
"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly shaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well."<p></p><p></p>
"But you—how are you?" cried Elizabeth. "You look pale. How much you must have gone through!"<p></p><p></p>
Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.<p></p><p></p>
When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father, to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes' conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing.<p></p><p></p>
"If I had been able," said she, "to carry my point in going to Brighton, with all my family, this would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham, wherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we shall do."<p></p><p></p>
They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.<p></p><p></p>
"Do not give way to useless alarm," added he; "though it is right to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! my dear brother," replied Mrs. Bennet, "that is exactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, make them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my wits—and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me—such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all."<p></p><p></p>
But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.<p></p><p></p>
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it better that one only of the household, and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject.<p></p><p></p>
In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:<p></p><p></p>
"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation."<p></p><p></p>
Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, "Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one false step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.<p></p><p></p>
In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, "But tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever."<p></p><p></p>
"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He was coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey."<p></p><p></p>
"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes; but, when questioned by him, Denny denied knowing anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying—and from that, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before."<p></p><p></p>
"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"<p></p><p></p>
"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a little uneasy—a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their being in love with each other, many weeks."<p></p><p></p>
"But not before they went to Brighton?"<p></p><p></p>
"No, I believe not."<p></p><p></p>
"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does he know his real character?"<p></p><p></p>
"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him, this could not have happened!"<p></p><p></p>
"Perhaps it would have been better," replied her sister. "But to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions."<p></p><p></p>
"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his wife?"<p></p><p></p>
"He brought it with him for us to see."<p></p><p></p>
Jane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These were the contents:<p></p><p></p>
"MY DEAR HARRIET,<p></p><p></p>
"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign my name 'Lydia Wickham.' What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey.<p></p><p></p>
"Your affectionate friend,<p></p><p></p>
"LYDIA BENNET."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!" cried Elizabeth when she had finished it. "What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a scheme of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!"<p></p><p></p>
"I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! Jane," cried Elizabeth, "was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"<p></p><p></p>
"I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties."<p></p><p></p>
"Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone."<p></p><p></p>
"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters', if they should be of use to us."<p></p><p></p>
"She had better have stayed at home," cried Elizabeth; "perhaps she meant well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied."<p></p><p></p>
She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.<p></p><p></p>
"He meant I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone, and his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this."<p></p><p></p>

The whole party were in hopes of a letter from <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> family knew <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.

Gardiner had waited only for the letters before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> set off.<p></p><p></p>
When <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> promised, at parting, to prevail on <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could, to the great consolation of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, who considered it as the only security for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>'s not being killed in a duel.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> presence might be serviceable to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">nephews</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> shared in their attendance on <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other <span class="transformed">uncle</span> also visited them frequently, and always, as <span class="transformed">he</span> said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up—though, as <span class="transformed">he</span> never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, <span class="transformed">he</span> seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than <span class="transformed">he</span> found them.<p></p><p></p>
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family. Everybody declared that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was the wickedest young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> goodness. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, though <span class="transformed">he</span> did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> former assurance of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s ruin more certain; and even <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which <span class="transformed">he</span> had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span> received a letter from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; it told them that, on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> arrival, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had immediately found out <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, and persuaded <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to come to Gracechurch Street; that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> did not expect any success from this measure, but as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> was eager in it, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> meant to assist <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in pursuing it. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> added that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:<p></p><p></p>
"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to find out, if possible, from some of the young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>'s intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has now concealed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>. If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span> could tell us what relations <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has now living, better than any other person."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> authority proceeded; but it was not in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. <span class="transformed">He</span> had never heard of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> having had any relations, except a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> and <span class="transformed">father</span>, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> companions in the ——shire might be able to give more information; and though <span class="transformed">he</span> was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.<p></p><p></p>
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.<p></p><p></p>
But before they heard again from <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, from a different quarter, from <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins; which, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had received directions to open all that came for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> absence, <span class="transformed">he</span> accordingly read; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, who knew what curiosities <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> letters always were, looked over <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and read it likewise. It was as follows:<p></p><p></p>
"MY DEAR SIR,<p></p><p></p>
"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>, that <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune—or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your <span class="transformed">son</span> would have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span> informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your <span class="transformed">son</span> has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, I am inclined to think that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own disposition must be naturally bad, or <span class="transformed">he</span> could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins, but likewise by <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>, to whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one <span class="transformed">son</span> will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others; for who, as <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> <span class="transformed">himself</span> condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to reap the fruits of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own heinous offense.<p></p><p></p>
"I am, dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>, etc., etc."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner did not write again till <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> kept up any connection, and it was certain that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had no near one living. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> former acquaintances had been numerous; but since <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been in the militia, it did not appear that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was on terms of particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. And in the wretched state of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> fear of discovery by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s relations, for it had just transpired that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had left gaming debts behind <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to a very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> expenses at Brighton. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> owed a good deal in town, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> debts of honour were still more formidable. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> heard them with horror. "A gamester!" <span class="transformed">he</span> cried. "This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner added in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> letter, that they might expect to see their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had yielded to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>-in-law's entreaty that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would return to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> family, and leave it to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was told of this, <span class="transformed">he</span> did not express so much satisfaction as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> children expected, considering what <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> anxiety for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> life had been before.<p></p><p></p>
"What, is <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> coming home, and without poor <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>?" <span class="transformed">he</span> cried. "Sure <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will not leave London before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> marry <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> comes away?"<p></p><p></p>
As <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that <span class="transformed">he</span> and the children should go to London, at the same time that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span> back to Longbourn.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> Derbyshire friend that had attended <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> from that part of the world. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">nephew</span>; and the kind of half-expectation which <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, had ended in nothing. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had received none since <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> return that could come from Pemberley.<p></p><p></p>
The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be fairly conjectured from that, though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own feelings, was perfectly aware that, had <span class="transformed">he</span> known nothing of Darcy, <span class="transformed">he</span> could have borne the dread of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> thought, one sleepless night out of two.<p></p><p></p>
When <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet arrived, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had all the appearance of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> usual philosophic composure. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> said as little as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> away, and it was some time before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">sons</span> had courage to speak of it.<p></p><p></p>
It was not till the afternoon, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had joined them at tea, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> briefly expressing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> sorrow for what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must have endured, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> replied, "Say nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it."<p></p><p></p>
"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon enough."<p></p><p></p>
"Do you suppose them to be in London?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"<p></p><p></p>
"And <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> used to want to go to London," added <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">He</span> is happy then," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> drily; "and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> residence there will probably be of some duration."<p></p><p></p>
Then after a short silence <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> continued:<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind."<p></p><p></p>
They were interrupted by <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, who came to fetch <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>'s tea.<p></p><p></p>
"This is a parade," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> cried, "which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> runs away."<p></p><p></p>
"I am not going to run away, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mamma</span></span>," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> fretfully. "If I should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"You go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your <span class="transformed">brothers</span>. And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.<p></p><p></p>
"Well, well," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good <span class="transformed">boy</span> for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them."<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him. His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of that they would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.<p></p><p></p>
When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could, to the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only security for her husband's not being killed in a duel.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of cheering and heartening them up—though, as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickham's extravagance or irregularity, she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them.<p></p><p></p>
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman's family. Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of her sister's ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of them.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:<p></p><p></p>
"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if possible, from some of the young man's intimates in the regiment, whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any other person."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of his companions in the ——shire might be able to give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a something to look forward to.<p></p><p></p>
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was the grand object of every morning's impatience. Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.<p></p><p></p>
But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence, she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as follows:<p></p><p></p>
"MY DEAR SIR,<p></p><p></p>
"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune—or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an age.

"I am, dear sir, etc., etc."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he had been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia's relations, for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. "A gamester!" she cried. "This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law's entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before.<p></p><p></p>
"What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?" she cried. "Sure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?"<p></p><p></p>
As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.<p></p><p></p>

When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him away, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it.<p></p><p></p>
It was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, "Say nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it."<p></p><p></p>
"You must not be too severe upon yourself," replied Elizabeth.<p></p><p></p>
"You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression. It will pass away soon enough."<p></p><p></p>
"Do you suppose them to be in London?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"<p></p><p></p>
"And Lydia used to want to go to London," added Kitty.<p></p><p></p>
"She is happy then," said her father drily; "and her residence there will probably be of some duration."<p></p><p></p>
Then after a short silence he continued:<p></p><p></p>
"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind."<p></p><p></p>
They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother's tea.<p></p><p></p>
"This is a parade," he cried, "which does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away."<p></p><p></p>
"I am not going to run away, papa," said Kitty fretfully. "If I should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."<p></p><p></p>
"You go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner."<p></p><p></p>
Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.<p></p><p></p>
"Well, well," said he, "do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them."<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Two days after <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet's return, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that <span class="transformed">he</span> came to call them to their <span class="transformed">father</span>, went forward to meet <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> said to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, "I beg your pardon, <span class="transformed">sir</span>, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."<p></p><p></p>
"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town."<p></p><p></p>
"Dear <span class="transformed">sir</span>," cried <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span> from <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner? <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> has been here this half-hour, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span> has had a letter."<p></p><p></p>
Away ran the <span class="transformed">boys</span>, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the library; their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> was in neither; and they were on the point of seeking <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> up stairs with their <span class="transformed">father</span>, when they were met by the butler, who said:<p></p><p></p>
"If you are looking for my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span>, ma'am, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is walking towards the little copse."<p></p><p></p>
Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more, and ran across the lawn after their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, who was deliberately pursuing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, soon lagged behind, while <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, panting for breath, came up with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and eagerly cried out:<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mamma</span></span>, what news—what news? Have you heard from my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes I have had a letter from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> by express."<p></p><p></p>
"Well, and what news does it bring—good or bad?"<p></p><p></p>
"What is there of good to be expected?" said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, taking the letter from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> pocket. "But perhaps you would like to read it."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> impatiently caught it from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> hand. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> now came up.<p></p><p></p>
"Read it aloud," said their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, "for I hardly know myself what it is about."<p></p><p></p>
"Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.<p></p><p></p>
"MY DEAR BROTHER,<p></p><p></p>
"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my <span class="transformed">nephew</span>, and such as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered. I have seen them both—"<p></p><p></p>
"Then it is as I always hoped," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>; "they are married!"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> read on:<p></p><p></p>
"I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure to your <span class="transformed">son</span>, by settlement, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my <span class="transformed">brother</span>; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money, even when all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> debts are discharged, to settle on my <span class="transformed">nephew</span>, in addition to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my <span class="transformed">nephew</span> should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. <span class="transformed">He</span> comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,<p></p><p></p>
"EDW. GARDINER."<p></p><p></p>
"Is it possible?" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, when <span class="transformed">he</span> had finished. "Can it be possible that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will marry <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>. "My dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, I congratulate you."<p></p><p></p>
"And have you answered the letter?" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"No; but it must be done soon."<p></p><p></p>
Most earnestly did <span class="transformed">he</span> then entreat <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to lose no more time before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> wrote.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>," <span class="transformed">he</span> cried, "come back and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a case."<p></p><p></p>
"Let me write for you," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, "if you dislike the trouble yourself."<p></p><p></p>
"I dislike it very much," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> replied; "but it must be done."<p></p><p></p>
And so saying, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> turned back with them, and walked towards the house.<p></p><p></p>
"And may I ask—" said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; "but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with."<p></p><p></p>
"Complied with! I am only ashamed of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> asking so little."<p></p><p></p>
"And they must marry! Yet <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is such a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>!"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Money! My <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>!" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, "what do you mean, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">madam</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"I mean, that no <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> senses would marry <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone."<p></p><p></p>
"That is very true," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; "though it had not occurred to me before. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>'s doings! Generous, good <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, I am afraid <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has distressed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>. A small sum could not do all this."<p></p><p></p>
"No," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>; "Wickham's a fool if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> takes <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, in the very beginning of our relationship."<p></p><p></p>
"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> then went on to the library to write, and the <span class="transformed">boys</span> walked into the breakfast-room.<p></p><p></p>
"And they are really to be married!" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, as soon as they were by themselves. "How strange this is! And for this we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>!"<p></p><p></p>
"I comfort myself with thinking," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, "that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> certainly would not marry <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had not a real regard for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. Though our kind <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> has done something towards clearing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> has children of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own, and may have more. How could <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> spare half ten thousand pounds?"<p></p><p></p>
"If <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "and how much is settled on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> side on our <span class="transformed">brother</span>, we shall exactly know what <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own. The kindness of my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span> can never be requited. Their taking <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> home, and affording <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time <span class="transformed">he</span> is actually with them! If such goodness does not make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> miserable now, <span class="transformed">he</span> will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, when <span class="transformed">he</span> first sees my <span class="transformed">uncle</span>!"<p></p><p></p>
"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> consenting to marry <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> is a proof, I will believe, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten."<p></p><p></p>
"Their conduct has been such," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "as neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it."<p></p><p></p>
It now occurred to the <span class="transformed">boys</span> that their <span class="transformed">father</span> was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library, therefore, and asked their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> whether <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would not wish them to make it known to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was writing and, without raising <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> head, coolly replied:<p></p><p></p>
"Just as you please."<p></p><p></p>
"May we take my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>'s letter to read to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"Take whatever you like, and get away."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> took the letter from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> writing-table, and they went up stairs together. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> were both with <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet could hardly contain <span class="transformed">himself</span>. As soon as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had read <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner's hope of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s being soon married, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. <span class="transformed">He</span> was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as <span class="transformed">he</span> had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span> would be married was enough. <span class="transformed">He</span> was disturbed by no fear for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> misconduct.<p></p><p></p>
"My dear, dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>!" <span class="transformed">he</span> cried. "This is delightful indeed! <span class="transformed">He</span> will be married! I shall see <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> again! <span class="transformed">He</span> will be married at sixteen! My good, kind <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>! I knew how it would be. I knew <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would manage everything! How I long to see <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my <span class="transformed">brother</span> Gardiner about them directly. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, my dear, run down to your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, and ask <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> how much <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will give <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>! How merry we shall be together when we meet!"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> eldest <span class="transformed">son</span> endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> thoughts to the obligations which <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.<p></p><p></p>
"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," <span class="transformed">he</span> added, "in a great measure to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> kindness. We are persuaded that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has pledged <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> to assist <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham with money."<p></p><p></p>
"Well," cried <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, "it is all very right; who should do it but <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>? If <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had not had a family of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own, I and my children must have had all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> money, you know; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a <span class="transformed">son</span> married. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Wickham! How well it sounds! And <span class="transformed">he</span> was only sixteen last June. My dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, though with some difficulty, persuaded <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to wait till <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, <span class="transformed">he</span> observed, would be of small importance; and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> head.<p></p><p></p>
"I will go to Meryton," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my <span class="transformed">brother</span> Philips. And as I come back, I can call on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sir Lucas</span></span> and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Long. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, run down and order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. <span class="transformed">Boys</span>, can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? <span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> wedding."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hill began instantly to express <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> joy. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> received <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own room, that <span class="transformed">he</span> might think with freedom.<p></p><p></p>
Poor <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, <span class="transformed">he</span> had need to be thankful. <span class="transformed">He</span> felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, <span class="transformed">he</span> felt all the advantages of what they had gained.<p></p><p></p>

Two days after Mr. Bennet's return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, "I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask."<p></p><p></p>
"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town."<p></p><p></p>
"Dear madam," cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, "don't you know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter."<p></p><p></p>
Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.

Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out:<p></p><p></p>

"Yes I have had a letter from him by express."<p></p><p></p>
"Well, and what news does it bring—good or bad?"<p></p><p></p>
"What is there of good to be expected?" said he, taking the letter from his pocket. "But perhaps you would like to read it."<p></p><p></p>

They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,<p></p><p></p>
"EDW. GARDINER."<p></p><p></p>
"Is it possible?" cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. "Can it be possible that he will marry her?"<p></p><p></p>
"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him," said her sister. "My dear father, I congratulate you."<p></p><p></p>
"And have you answered the letter?" cried Elizabeth.<p></p><p></p>
"No; but it must be done soon."<p></p><p></p>
Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! my dear father," she cried, "come back and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a case."<p></p><p></p>
"Let me write for you," said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble yourself."<p></p><p></p>
"I dislike it very much," he replied; "but it must be done."<p></p><p></p>
And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.<p></p><p></p>
"And may I ask—" said Elizabeth; "but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with."<p></p><p></p>
"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little."<p></p><p></p>
"And they must marry! Yet he is such a man!"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him."<p></p><p></p>
"Money! My uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, sir?"<p></p><p></p>
"I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone."<p></p><p></p>
"That is very true," said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle's doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this."<p></p><p></p>
"No," said her father; "Wickham's a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."<p></p><p></p>
"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?"<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.<p></p><p></p>
"And they are really to be married!" cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. "How strange this is! And for this we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!"<p></p><p></p>
"I comfort myself with thinking," replied Jane, "that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?"<p></p><p></p>
"If he were ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been," said Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!"<p></p><p></p>
"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side," said Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten."<p></p><p></p>
"Their conduct has been such," replied Elizabeth, "as neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it."<p></p><p></p>
It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly replied:<p></p><p></p>
"Just as you please."<p></p><p></p>
"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"<p></p><p></p>
"Take whatever you like, and get away."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.<p></p><p></p>
"My dear, dear Lydia!" she cried. "This is delightful indeed! She will be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!"<p></p><p></p>
Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under.<p></p><p></p>
"For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she added, "in a great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money."<p></p><p></p>
"Well," cried her mother, "it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."<p></p><p></p>
She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.<p></p><p></p>
"I will go to Meryton," said she, "as soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding."<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.<p></p><p></p>
Poor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had gained.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet had very often wished before this period of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> life that, instead of spending <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> whole income, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> children, and of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>, if <span class="transformed">he</span> survived <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> now wished it more than ever. Had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> done <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> duty in that respect, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> need not have been indebted to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span> in Great Britain to be <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> might then have rested in its proper place.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>-in-law, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could.<p></p><p></p>
When first <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span>. The <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span> was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should be of age, and the <span class="transformed">widower</span> and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five <span class="transformed">sons</span> successively entered the world, but yet the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span> was to come; and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, for many years after <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s birth, had been certain that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet had no turn for economy, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>'s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.<p></p><p></p>
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, at least, which was now to be settled, and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, though expressed most concisely, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> then delivered on paper <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> perfect approbation of all that was done, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">son</span>, it would be done with so little inconvenience to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> as by the present arrangement. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> through <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>'s hands, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s expenses had been very little within that sum.<p></p><p></p>
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports of rage which had produced <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> activity in seeking <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> were over, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> naturally returned to all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> former indolence. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was quick in its execution. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> begged to know further particulars of what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was indebted to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, but was too angry with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> to send any message to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had <span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; and the good-natured wishes for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> misery was considered certain.<p></p><p></p>
It was a fortnight since <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this happy day <span class="transformed">he</span> again took <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> seat at the head of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> triumph. The marriage of a <span class="transformed">son</span>, which had been the first object of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> wishes since <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> thoughts and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. <span class="transformed">He</span> was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.<p></p><p></p>
"Haye Park might do," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "if the Gouldings could quit it—or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> allowed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to talk on without interruption while the servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> said to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>: "<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span> and <span class="transformed">son</span>, let us come to a right understanding. Into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."<p></p><p></p>
A long dispute followed this declaration; but <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet was firm. It soon led to another; and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">son</span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> protested that <span class="transformed">he</span> should receive from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> no mark of affection whatever on the occasion. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">son</span> a privilege without which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all <span class="transformed">he</span> could believe possible. <span class="transformed">He</span> was more alive to the disgrace which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> want of new clothes must reflect on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>'s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was now most heartily sorry that <span class="transformed">he</span> had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy acquainted with their fears for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>; for since <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> had no fear of its spreading farther through <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> means. There were few people on whose secrecy <span class="transformed">he</span> would have more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s frailty would have mortified <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> so much—not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to <span class="transformed">himself</span>, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy would connect <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> with a family where, to every other objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> so justly scorned.<p></p><p></p>
From such a connection <span class="transformed">he</span> could not wonder that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would shrink. The wish of procuring <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> regard, which <span class="transformed">he</span> had assured <span class="transformed">himself</span> of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this. <span class="transformed">He</span> was humbled, <span class="transformed">he</span> was grieved; <span class="transformed">he</span> repented, though <span class="transformed">he</span> hardly knew of what. <span class="transformed">He</span> became jealous of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> esteem, when <span class="transformed">he</span> could no longer hope to be benefited by it. <span class="transformed">He</span> wanted to hear of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. <span class="transformed">He</span> was convinced that <span class="transformed">he</span> could have been happy with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, when it was no longer likely they should meet.<p></p><p></p>
What a triumph for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, as <span class="transformed">he</span> often thought, could <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> know that the proposals which <span class="transformed">he</span> had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was as generous, <span class="transformed">he</span> doubted not, as the most generous of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> sex; but while <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was mortal, there must be a triumph.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> began now to comprehend that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was exactly the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> who, in disposition and talents, would most suit <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> understanding and temper, though unlike <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own, would have answered all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ease and liveliness, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> mind might have been softened, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> manners improved; and from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, <span class="transformed">he</span> must have received benefit of greater importance.<p></p><p></p>
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.<p></p><p></p>
How Wickham and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> were to be supported in tolerable independence, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, <span class="transformed">he</span> could easily conjecture.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner soon wrote again to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>. To <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet's acknowledgments <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> briefly replied, with assurance of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> eagerness to promote the welfare of any of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> family; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> again. The principal purport of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> letter was to inform them that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham had resolved on quitting the militia.<p></p><p></p>
"It was greatly my wish that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should do so," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> added, "as soon as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> account and my <span class="transformed">nephew</span>'s. It is <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and among <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in the army. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> has the promise of an ensigncy in General ——'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> of our present arrangements, and to request that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will satisfy the various creditors of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> information? <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> has given in all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> debts; I hope at least <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They will then join <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner, that my <span class="transformed">nephew</span> is very desirous of seeing you all before <span class="transformed">he</span> leaves the South. <span class="transformed">He</span> is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>.—Yours, etc.,<p></p><p></p>
"E. GARDINER."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">sons</span> saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the ——shire as clearly as <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner could do. But <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s being settled in the North, just when <span class="transformed">he</span> had expected most pleasure and pride in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> company, for <span class="transformed">he</span> had by no means given up <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> should be taken from a regiment where <span class="transformed">he</span> was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">He</span> is so fond of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Forster," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "it will be quite shocking to send <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> away! And there are several of the young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span>, too, that <span class="transformed">he</span> likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ——'s regiment."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> <span class="transformed">son</span>'s request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family again before <span class="transformed">he</span> set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative. But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s feelings and consequence, that <span class="transformed">he</span> should be noticed on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> marriage by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> parents, urged <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their <span class="transformed">father</span> had the satisfaction of knowing that <span class="transformed">he</span> would be able to show <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> married <span class="transformed">son</span> in the neighbourhood before <span class="transformed">he</span> was banished to the North. When <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet wrote again to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, therefore, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> sent <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and had <span class="transformed">he</span> consulted only <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own inclination, any meeting with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> would have been the last object of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> wishes.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that, instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.<p></p><p></p>
He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.<p></p><p></p>
When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her husband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income.<p></p><p></p>
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within that sum.<p></p><p></p>
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was another very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her.<p></p><p></p>
The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery was considered certain.<p></p><p></p>
It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance.<p></p><p></p>
"Haye Park might do," said she, "if the Gouldings could quit it—or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."<p></p><p></p>
Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: "Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn."<p></p><p></p>
A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter's nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot.<p></p><p></p>
She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister's frailty would have mortified her so much—not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.<p></p><p></p>
From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet.<p></p><p></p>
What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she doubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal, there must be a triumph.<p></p><p></p>
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved; and from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she must have received benefit of greater importance.<p></p><p></p>
But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their family.<p></p><p></p>
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence, she could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet's acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the militia.<p></p><p></p>
"It was greatly my wish that he should do so," he added, "as soon as his marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his account and my niece's. It is Mr. Wickham's intention to go into the regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an ensigncy in General ——'s regiment, now quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment, unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother.—Yours, etc.,<p></p><p></p>
"E. GARDINER."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham's removal from the ——shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites.<p></p><p></p>
"She is so fond of Mrs. Forster," said she, "it will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ——'s regiment."<p></p><p></p>
His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister's feelings and consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents, urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Their <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s wedding day arrived; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> felt for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> probably more than <span class="transformed">he</span> felt for <span class="transformed">himself</span>. The carriage was sent to meet them at ——, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennets, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> more especially, who gave <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> the feelings which would have attended <span class="transformed">himself</span>, had <span class="transformed">he</span> been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> must endure.<p></p><p></p>
They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them. Smiles decked the face of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door; <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> looked impenetrably grave; <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">sons</span>, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and <span class="transformed">he</span> ran into the room. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> stepped forwards, embraced <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and welcomed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with rapture; gave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.<p></p><p></p>
Their reception from <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> countenance rather gained in austerity; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> scarcely opened <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was disgusted, and even <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet was shocked. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> was <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. <span class="transformed">He</span> turned from <span class="transformed">brother</span> to <span class="transformed">brother</span>, demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since <span class="transformed">he</span> had been there.<p></p><p></p>
Wickham was not at all more distressed than <span class="transformed">himself</span>, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> manners were always so pleasing, that had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> character and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> marriage been exactly what they ought, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> smiles and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> easy address, while <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had not before believed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> quite equal to such assurance; but <span class="transformed">he</span> sat down, resolving within <span class="transformed">himself</span> to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> blushed, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.<p></p><p></p>
There was no want of discourse. The <span class="transformed">bridegroom</span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, began inquiring after <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which <span class="transformed">he</span> felt very unable to equal in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> led voluntarily to subjects which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> would not have alluded to for the world.<p></p><p></p>
"Only think of its being three months," <span class="transformed">he</span> cried, "since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> lifted up <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> eyes. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was distressed. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> looked expressively at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>; but <span class="transformed">he</span>, who never heard nor saw anything of which <span class="transformed">he</span> chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh! <span class="transformed">papa</span>, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Emma</span></span> Goulding in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> curricle, so I was determined <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could bear it no longer. <span class="transformed">He</span> got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till <span class="transformed">he</span> heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour. <span class="transformed">He</span> then joined them soon enough to see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, with anxious parade, walk up to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>'s right hand, and hear <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> say to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eldest <span class="transformed">brother</span>, "Ah! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married <span class="transformed">man</span>."<p></p><p></p>
It was not to be supposed that time would give <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> that embarrassment from which <span class="transformed">he</span> had been so wholly free at first. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> ease and good spirits increased. <span class="transformed">He</span> longed to see <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear <span class="transformed">himself</span> called "<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Wickham" by each of them; and in the mean time, <span class="transformed">he</span> went after dinner to show <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ring, and boast of being married, to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Hill and the two housemaids.<p></p><p></p>
"Well, <span class="transformed">papa</span>," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>? Is not <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> a charming <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>? I am sure my <span class="transformed">brothers</span> must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wives</span></span>. What a pity it is, <span class="transformed">papa</span>, we did not all go."<p></p><p></p>
"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, I don't at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, lord! yes;—there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mamma</span></span>, and my <span class="transformed">brothers</span>, must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all."<p></p><p></p>
"I should like it beyond anything!" said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my <span class="transformed">brothers</span> behind you; and I dare say I shall get <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wives</span></span> for them before the winter is over."<p></p><p></p>
"I thank you for my share of the favour," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; "but I do not particularly like your way of getting <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wives</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham had received <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> commission before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> left London, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was to join <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> regiment at the end of a fortnight.<p></p><p></p>
No one but <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and <span class="transformed">he</span> made the most of the time by visiting about with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>, and having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.<p></p><p></p>
Wickham's affection for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> was just what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had expected to find it; not equal to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> had scarcely needed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> love, rather than by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; and <span class="transformed">he</span> would have wondered why, without violently caring for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> chose to elope with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> at all, had <span class="transformed">he</span> not felt certain that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was not the young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> to resist an opportunity of having a companion.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> was exceedingly fond of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> did every thing best in the world; and <span class="transformed">he</span> was sure <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.<p></p><p></p>
One morning, soon after their arrival, as <span class="transformed">he</span> was sitting with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> two elder <span class="transformed">brothers</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> said to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>:<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe. You were not by, when I told <span class="transformed">papa</span> and the others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"<p></p><p></p>
"No really," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; "I think there cannot be too little said on the subject."<p></p><p></p>
"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span> and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if <span class="transformed">he</span> was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would be married in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> blue coat."<p></p><p></p>
"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span> were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> was called away upon business to that horrid <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy might have done as well."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy!" repeated <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, in utter amazement.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, yes!—<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"<p></p><p></p>
"If it was to be secret," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, "say not another word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! certainly," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions."<p></p><p></p>
"Thank you," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."<p></p><p></p>
On such encouragement to ask, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was forced to put it out of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> power, by running away.<p></p><p></p>
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy had been at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> brain; but <span class="transformed">he</span> was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, as placing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. <span class="transformed">He</span> could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, to request an explanation of what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.<p></p><p></p>
"You may readily comprehend," <span class="transformed">he</span> added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."<p></p><p></p>
"Not that I shall, though," <span class="transformed">he</span> added to <span class="transformed">himself</span>, as <span class="transformed">he</span> finished the letter; "and my dear <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s delicate sense of honour would not allow <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to speak to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> privately of what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> had let fall; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was glad of it;—till it appeared whether <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> inquiries would receive any satisfaction, <span class="transformed">he</span> had rather be without a confidante.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Their sister's wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at ——, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure.<p></p><p></p>
They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.<p></p><p></p>
Lydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.<p></p><p></p>
Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been there.<p></p><p></p>
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners were always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.<p></p><p></p>
There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.<p></p><p></p>
"Only think of its being three months," she cried, "since I went away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was."<p></p><p></p>
Her father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, "Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room; and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister, "Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married woman."<p></p><p></p>
It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called "Mrs. Wickham" by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.<p></p><p></p>
"Well, mamma," said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."<p></p><p></p>
"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, lord! yes;—there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all."<p></p><p></p>
"I should like it beyond anything!" said her mother.<p></p><p></p>
"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over."<p></p><p></p>
"I thank you for my share of the favour," said Elizabeth; "but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."<p></p><p></p>
Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.<p></p><p></p>
No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.<p></p><p></p>
Wickham's affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.<p></p><p></p>
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country.<p></p><p></p>
One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:<p></p><p></p>
"Lizzy, I never gave you an account of my wedding, I believe. You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"<p></p><p></p>
"No really," replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too little said on the subject."<p></p><p></p>
"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were married, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat."<p></p><p></p>
"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well."<p></p><p></p>
"Mr. Darcy!" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, yes!—he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!"<p></p><p></p>
"If it was to be secret," said Jane, "say not another word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! certainly," said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; "we will ask you no questions."<p></p><p></p>
"Thank you," said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."<p></p><p></p>
On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away.<p></p><p></p>
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her sister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended.<p></p><p></p>
"You may readily comprehend," she added, "what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."<p></p><p></p>
"Not that I shall, though," she added to herself, as she finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out."<p></p><p></p>
Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;—till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.<p></p><p></p>

<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> letter as soon as <span class="transformed">he</span> possibly could. <span class="transformed">He</span> was no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where <span class="transformed">he</span> was least likely to be interrupted, <span class="transformed">he</span> sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that it did not contain a denial.<p></p><p></p>
"Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.<p></p><p></p>
"MY DEAR NIECE,<p></p><p></p>
"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from you. Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> is as much surprised as I am—and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to act as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.<p></p><p></p>
"On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> had a most unexpected visitor. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy called, and was shut up with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> came to tell <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had found out where your <span class="transformed">brother</span> and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham were, and that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> once. From what I can collect, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive professed was <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> conviction of its being owing to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young <span class="transformed">man</span> of character to love or confide in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> generously imputed the whole to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> mistaken pride, and confessed that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had before thought it beneath <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to lay <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> private actions open to the world. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> character was to speak for itself. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> called it, therefore, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>. If <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had another motive, I am sure it would never disgrace <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had been some days in town, before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was able to discover them; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had something to direct <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> search, which was more than we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> resolving to follow us.<p></p><p></p>
"There is a <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>, it seems, a <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Younge, who was some time ago governess to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy, and was dismissed from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> charge on some cause of disapprobation, though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did not say what. <span class="transformed">He</span> then took a large house in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Gladys</span></span>-street, and has since maintained <span class="transformed">himself</span> by letting lodgings. This <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Younge was, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> went to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for intelligence of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> as soon as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> got to town. But it was two or three days before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could get from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> wanted. <span class="transformed">He</span> would not betray <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for <span class="transformed">he</span> really did know where <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> on their first arrival in London, and had <span class="transformed">he</span> been able to receive them into <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> house, they would have taken up their abode with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in —— street. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> first object with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> acknowledged, had been to persuade <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to quit <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> present disgraceful situation, and return to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, offering <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> assistance, as far as it would go. But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> found <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> absolutely resolved on remaining where <span class="transformed">he</span> was. <span class="transformed">He</span> cared for none of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friends; <span class="transformed">he</span> wanted no help of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; <span class="transformed">he</span> would not hear of leaving Wickham. <span class="transformed">He</span> was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feelings, it only remained, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> very first conversation with Wickham, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> easily learnt had never been <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> design. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> confessed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s flight on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own folly alone. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> meant to resign <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> commission immediately; and as to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> future situation, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could conjecture very little about it. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> must go somewhere, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did not know where, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> knew <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should have nothing to live on.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy asked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> why <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had not married your <span class="transformed">brother</span> at once. Though <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would have been able to do something for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> situation must have been benefited by marriage. But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.<p></p><p></p>
"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.<p></p><p></p>
"Every thing being settled between them, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's next step was to make your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> acquainted with it, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Gardiner could not be seen, and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> was still with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, but would quit town the next morning. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> did not judge your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> to be a person whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could so properly consult as your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>, and therefore readily postponed seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> till after the departure of the former. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> did not leave <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> name, and till the next day it was only known that a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> had called on business.<p></p><p></p>
"On Saturday <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> came again. Your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> was gone, your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.<p></p><p></p>
"They met again on Sunday, and then I saw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, that obstinacy is the real defect of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> character, after all. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> has been accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true one. Nothing was to be done that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did not do <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> would most readily have settled the whole.<p></p><p></p>
"They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> or <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> concerned in it deserved. But at last your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">nephew</span>, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, this must go no farther than yourself, or <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> at most.<p></p><p></p>
"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own settled upon <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been received and noticed as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was. Perhaps there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> reserve, or anybody's reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, you may rest perfectly assured that your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> would never have yielded, if we had not given <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> credit for another interest in the affair.<p></p><p></p>
"When all this was resolved on, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> returned again to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish.<p></p><p></p>
"I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was exactly what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been, when I knew <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> behaviour while <span class="transformed">he</span> staid with us, if I had not perceived, by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s letter last Wednesday, that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> all the wickedness of what <span class="transformed">he</span> had done, and all the unhappiness <span class="transformed">he</span> had brought on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family. If <span class="transformed">he</span> heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure <span class="transformed">he</span> did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, and for their sakes had patience with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy was punctual in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> return, and as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> informed you, attended the wedding. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> understanding and opinions all please me; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> marry prudently, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span> may teach <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. I thought <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> very sly;—<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion.<p></p><p></p>
"Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.<p></p><p></p>
"But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half hour.<p></p><p></p>
"Yours, very sincerely,<p></p><p></p>
"M. GARDINER."<p></p><p></p>
The contents of this letter threw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy might have been doing to forward <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s match, which <span class="transformed">he</span> had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had followed them purposely to town, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had taken on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a <span class="transformed">man</span> whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> must abominate and despise, and where <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to pronounce. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had done all this for a <span class="transformed">boy</span> whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could neither regard nor esteem. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> heart did whisper that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had done it for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and <span class="transformed">he</span> soon felt that even <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> affection for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>—for a <span class="transformed">man</span> who had already refused <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>—as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Sister</span></span>-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had, to be sure, done much. <span class="transformed">He</span> was ashamed to think how much. But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had given a reason for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should feel <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been wrong; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had liberality, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had the means of exercising it; and though <span class="transformed">he</span> would not place <span class="transformed">himself</span> as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> principal inducement, <span class="transformed">he</span> could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> might assist <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> endeavours in a cause where <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> peace of mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> character, every thing, to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. Oh! how heartily did <span class="transformed">he</span> grieve over every ungracious sensation <span class="transformed">he</span> had ever encouraged, every saucy speech <span class="transformed">he</span> had ever directed towards <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. For <span class="transformed">himself</span> <span class="transformed">he</span> was humbled; but <span class="transformed">he</span> was proud of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been able to get the better of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> read over <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span>'s commendation of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> again and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both <span class="transformed">he</span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy and <span class="transformed">himself</span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> was roused from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> seat, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> reflections, by some one's approach; and before <span class="transformed">he</span> could strike into another path, <span class="transformed">he</span> was overtaken by Wickham.<p></p><p></p>
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear <span class="transformed">brother</span>?" said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> joined <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"You certainly do," <span class="transformed">he</span> replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome."<p></p><p></p>
"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and now we are better."<p></p><p></p>
"True. Are the others coming out?"<p></p><p></p>
"I do not know. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> are going in the carriage to Meryton. And so, my dear <span class="transformed">brother</span>, I find, from our <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, that you have actually seen Pemberley."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> replied in the affirmative.<p></p><p></p>
"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, <span class="transformed">he</span> was always very fond of me. But of course <span class="transformed">he</span> did not mention my name to you."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, <span class="transformed">he</span> did."<p></p><p></p>
"And what did <span class="transformed">he</span> say?"<p></p><p></p>
"That you were gone into the army, and <span class="transformed">he</span> was afraid had—not turned out well. At such a distance as that, you know, things are strangely misrepresented."<p></p><p></p>
"Certainly," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> replied, biting <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> lips. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> hoped <span class="transformed">he</span> had silenced <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> soon afterwards said:<p></p><p></p>
"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other several times. I wonder what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> can be doing there."<p></p><p></p>
"Perhaps preparing for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> marriage with <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>. "It must be something particular, to take <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> there at this time of year."<p></p><p></p>
"Undoubtedly. Did you see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> introduced us to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"And do you like <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"Very much."<p></p><p></p>
"I have heard, indeed, that <span class="transformed">he</span> is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I last saw <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> was not very promising. I am very glad you liked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. I hope <span class="transformed">he</span> will turn out well."<p></p><p></p>
"I dare say <span class="transformed">he</span> will; <span class="transformed">he</span> has got over the most trying age."<p></p><p></p>
"Did you go by the village of Kympton?"<p></p><p></p>
"I do not recollect that we did."<p></p><p></p>
"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most delightful place!—Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect."<p></p><p></p>
"How should you have liked making sermons?"<p></p><p></p>
"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine;—but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?"<p></p><p></p>
"I have heard from authority, which I thought as good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."<p></p><p></p>
"You have. Yes, there was something in that; I told you so from the first, you may remember."<p></p><p></p>
"I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly."<p></p><p></p>
"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."<p></p><p></p>
They were now almost at the door of the house, for <span class="transformed">he</span> had walked fast to get rid of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; and unwilling, for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s sake, to provoke <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:<p></p><p></p>
"Come, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham, we are <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> and <span class="transformed">brother</span>, you know. Do not let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> held out <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> hand; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.<p></p><p></p>

Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.<p></p><p></p>
"Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.<p></p><p></p>
"MY DEAR NIECE,<p></p><p></p>
"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning to answering it, as I foresee that a little writing will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your application; I did not expect it from you. Don't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on your side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am—and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.<p></p><p></p>
"On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he had another motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than we had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.<p></p><p></p>
"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in —— street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been his design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia's flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on.<p></p><p></p>
"Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.<p></p><p></p>
"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.<p></p><p></p>
"Every thing being settled between them, Mr. Darcy's next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.<p></p><p></p>
"On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.<p></p><p></p>
"They met again on Sunday, and then I saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times, but this is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most readily have settled the whole.<p></p><p></p>
"They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at most.<p></p><p></p>
"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her, and his commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in this; though I doubt whether his reserve, or anybody's reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair.<p></p><p></p>
"When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to receive the last finish.<p></p><p></p>
"I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. He was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her.<p></p><p></p>
"Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and that, if he marry prudently, his wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;—he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion.<p></p><p></p>
"Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.<p></p><p></p>
"But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half hour.<p></p><p></p>
"Yours, very sincerely,<p></p><p></p>
"M. GARDINER."<p></p><p></p>
The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister's match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her—for a woman who had already refused him—as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh! how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself. She read over her aunt's commendation of him again and again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.<p></p><p></p>
She was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one's approach; and before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by Wickham.<p></p><p></p>
"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?" said he, as he joined her.<p></p><p></p>
"You certainly do," she replied with a smile; "but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome."<p></p><p></p>
"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and now we are better."<p></p><p></p>
"True. Are the others coming out?"<p></p><p></p>
"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley."<p></p><p></p>
She replied in the affirmative.<p></p><p></p>
"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my name to you."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, she did."<p></p><p></p>
"And what did she say?"<p></p><p></p>
"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had—not turned out well. At such a distance as that, you know, things are strangely misrepresented."<p></p><p></p>
"Certainly," he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said:<p></p><p></p>
"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there."<p></p><p></p>
"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh," said Elizabeth. "It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year."<p></p><p></p>
"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes; he introduced us to his sister."<p></p><p></p>
"And do you like her?"<p></p><p></p>
"Very much."<p></p><p></p>
"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well."<p></p><p></p>
"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age."<p></p><p></p>
"Did you go by the village of Kympton?"<p></p><p></p>
"I do not recollect that we did."<p></p><p></p>
"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most delightful place!—Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect."<p></p><p></p>
"How should you have liked making sermons?"<p></p><p></p>
"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine;—but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?"<p></p><p></p>
"I have heard from authority, which I thought as good, that it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron."<p></p><p></p>
"You have. Yes, there was something in that; I told you so from the first, you may remember."<p></p><p></p>
"I did hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business had been compromised accordingly."<p></p><p></p>
"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it."<p></p><p></p>
They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister's sake, to provoke him, she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:<p></p><p></p>
"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one mind."<p></p><p></p>
She held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though he hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> never again distressed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, or provoked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> dear <span class="transformed">brother</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, by introducing the subject of it; and <span class="transformed">he</span> was pleased to find that <span class="transformed">he</span> had said enough to keep <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> quiet.<p></p><p></p>
The day of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s departure soon came, and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> by no means entered into <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>," <span class="transformed">he</span> cried, "when shall we meet again?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps."<p></p><p></p>
"Write to me very often, my dear."<p></p><p></p>
"As often as I can. But you know married <span class="transformed">men</span> have never much time for writing. My <span class="transformed">brothers</span> may write to me. They will have nothing else to do."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>'s. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> smiled, looked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>, and said many pretty things.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is as fine a fellow," said <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever I saw. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. I defy even <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> Lucas <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> to produce a more valuable <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span>-in-law."<p></p><p></p>
The loss of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span> made <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet very dull for several days.<p></p><p></p>
"I often think," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them."<p></p><p></p>
"This is the consequence, you see, <span class="transformed">Sir</span>, of marrying a <span class="transformed">son</span>," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>. "It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single."<p></p><p></p>
"It is no such thing. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> does not leave me because <span class="transformed">he</span> is married, but only because <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>'s regiment happens to be so far off. If that had been nearer, <span class="transformed">he</span> would not have gone so soon."<p></p><p></p>
But the spiritless condition which this event threw <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> into was shortly relieved, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mistress</span></span>, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. <span class="transformed">He</span> looked at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, and smiled and shook <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> head by turns.<p></p><p></p>
"Well, well, and so <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley is coming down, <span class="transformed">brother</span>," (for <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips first brought <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> the news). "Well, so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> again. But, however, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> likes it. And who knows what may happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, <span class="transformed">brother</span>, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is coming?"<p></p><p></p>
"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and <span class="transformed">he</span> told me that it was certain true. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. <span class="transformed">He</span> was going to the butcher's, <span class="transformed">he</span> told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and <span class="transformed">he</span> has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet had not been able to hear of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> coming without changing colour. It was many months since <span class="transformed">he</span> had mentioned <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> name to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; but now, as soon as they were alone together, <span class="transformed">he</span> said:<p></p><p></p>
"I saw you look at me to-day, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, when my <span class="transformed">uncle</span> told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> comes alone; because we shall see the less of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. Not that I am afraid of myself, but I dread other people's remarks."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> did not know what to make of it. Had <span class="transformed">he</span> not seen <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in Derbyshire, <span class="transformed">he</span> might have supposed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but <span class="transformed">he</span> still thought <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> partial to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, and <span class="transformed">he</span> wavered as to the greater probability of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> coming there with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it.<p></p><p></p>
"Yet it is hard," <span class="transformed">he</span> sometimes thought, "that this poor <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> cannot come to a house which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I will leave <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
In spite of what <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> declared, and really believed to be <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feelings in the expectation of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> arrival, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could easily perceive that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed, more unequal, than <span class="transformed">he</span> had often seen them.<p></p><p></p>
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.<p></p><p></p>
"As soon as ever <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley comes, my dear," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, "you will wait on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> of course."<p></p><p></p>
"No, no. You forced me into visiting <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> last year, and promised, if I went to see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should marry one of my <span class="transformed">sons</span>. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span> represented to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span>, on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> returning to Netherfield.<p></p><p></p>
"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>. "If <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> wants our society, let <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> seek it. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> knows where we live. I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again."<p></p><p></p>
"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to dine here, I am determined. We must have <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
Consoled by this resolution, <span class="transformed">he</span> was the better able to bear <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>'s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> neighbours might all see <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, in consequence of it, before they did. As the day of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> arrival drew near,—<p></p><p></p>
"I begin to be sorry that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> comes at all," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>. "It would be nothing; I could see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My <span class="transformed">father</span> means well; but <span class="transformed">he</span> does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what <span class="transformed">he</span> says. Happy shall I be, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> stay at Netherfield is over!"<p></p><p></p>
"I wish I could say anything to comfort you," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; "but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley arrived. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> side might be as long as it could. <span class="transformed">He</span> counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> before. But on the third morning after <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> arrival in Hertfordshire, <span class="transformed">he</span> saw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride towards the house.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed">sons</span> were eagerly called to partake of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> joy. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> resolutely kept <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> place at the table; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, to satisfy <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, went to the window—<span class="transformed">he</span> looked,—<span class="transformed">he</span> saw <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and sat down again by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"There is a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, <span class="transformed">papa</span>," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>; "who can it be?"<p></p><p></p>
"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know."<p></p><p></p>
"La!" replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, "it looks just like that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> that used to be with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> before. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. what's-<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>-name. That tall, proud <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Good gracious! <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy!—and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> looked at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> with surprise and concern. <span class="transformed">He</span> knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, in seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> almost for the first time after receiving <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> explanatory letter. Both <span class="transformed">brothers</span> were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their <span class="transformed">father</span> talked on, of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> dislike of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> resolution to be civil to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> only as <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them. But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, to whom <span class="transformed">he</span> had never yet had courage to shew <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner's letter, or to relate <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own change of sentiment towards <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. To <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could be only a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> whose proposals <span class="transformed">he</span> had refused, and whose merit <span class="transformed">he</span> had undervalued; but to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own more extensive information, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom <span class="transformed">he</span> regarded <span class="transformed">himself</span> with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> felt for Bingley. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> astonishment at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> coming—at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> again, was almost equal to what <span class="transformed">he</span> had known on first witnessing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> altered behaviour in Derbyshire.<p></p><p></p>
The colour which had been driven from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes, as <span class="transformed">he</span> thought for that space of time that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But <span class="transformed">he</span> would not be secure.<p></p><p></p>
"Let me first see how <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> behaves," said <span class="transformed">he</span>; "it will then be early enough for expectation."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> as the servant was approaching the door. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had expected. On the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span>'s appearing, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> colour increased; yet <span class="transformed">he</span> received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. <span class="transformed">He</span> had ventured only one glance at Darcy. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> looked serious, as usual; and, <span class="transformed">he</span> thought, more as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as <span class="transformed">he</span> had seen <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at Pemberley. But, perhaps <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could not in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>'s presence be what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was before <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span>. It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.<p></p><p></p>
Bingley, <span class="transformed">he</span> had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> looking both pleased and embarrassed. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was received by <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet with a degree of civility which made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> two <span class="transformed">sons</span> ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> curtsey and address to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, particularly, who knew that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> owed to the latter the preservation of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> favourite <span class="transformed">son</span> from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.<p></p><p></p>
Darcy, after inquiring of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> how <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner did, a question which <span class="transformed">he</span> could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was not seated by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; perhaps that was the reason of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had talked to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friends, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> could not to <span class="transformed">himself</span>. But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, <span class="transformed">he</span> raised <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> face, <span class="transformed">he</span> as often found <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> looking at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> as at <span class="transformed">himself</span>, and frequently on no object but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed. <span class="transformed">He</span> was disappointed, and angry with <span class="transformed">himself</span> for being so.<p></p><p></p>
"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said <span class="transformed">he</span>. "Yet why did <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> come?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> was in no humour for conversation with anyone but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>; and to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">he</span> had hardly courage to speak.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> inquired after <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, but could do no more.<p></p><p></p>
"It is a long time, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, since you went away," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> readily agreed to it.<p></p><p></p>
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own <span class="transformed">sons</span>. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Georgiana</span></span> Wickham, Esq. to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, or the place where <span class="transformed">he</span> lived, or anything. It was my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> came to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?"<p></p><p></p>
Bingley replied that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did, and made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> congratulations. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> dared not lift up <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes. How <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy looked, therefore, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not tell.<p></p><p></p>
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a <span class="transformed">son</span> well married," continued <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, "but at the same time, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley, it is very hard to have <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> taken such a way from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> leaving the ——shire, and of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has some friends, though perhaps not so many as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> deserves."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, who knew this to be levelled at <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that <span class="transformed">he</span> could hardly keep <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> seat. It drew from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and <span class="transformed">he</span> asked Bingley whether <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> believed.<p></p><p></p>
"When you have killed all your own birds, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, "I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet's manor. I am sure <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, <span class="transformed">he</span> was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, <span class="transformed">he</span> felt that years of happiness could not make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> or <span class="transformed">himself</span> amends for moments of such painful confusion.<p></p><p></p>
"The first wish of my heart," said <span class="transformed">he</span> to <span class="transformed">himself</span>, "is never more to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!"<p></p><p></p>
Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> re-kindled the admiration of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> former lover. When first <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> came in, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had spoken to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> more of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attention. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> found <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span> as <span class="transformed">he</span> had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was anxious that no difference should be perceived in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> at all, and was really persuaded that <span class="transformed">he</span> talked as much as ever. But <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> mind was so busily engaged, that <span class="transformed">he</span> did not always know when <span class="transformed">he</span> was silent.<p></p><p></p>
When the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> rose to go away, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was mindful of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.<p></p><p></p>
"You are quite a visit in my debt, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley," <span class="transformed">he</span> added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement."<p></p><p></p>
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day; but, though <span class="transformed">he</span> always kept a very good table, <span class="transformed">he</span> did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> on whom <span class="transformed">he</span> had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet.<p></p><p></p>
The day of his and Lydia's departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! my dear Lydia," she cried, "when shall we meet again?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, lord! I don't know. Not these two or three years, perhaps."<p></p><p></p>
"Write to me very often, my dear."<p></p><p></p>
"As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for writing. My sisters may write to me. They will have nothing else to do."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Wickham's adieus were much more affectionate than his wife's. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.<p></p><p></p>
"He is as fine a fellow," said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, "as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law."<p></p><p></p>
The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.<p></p><p></p>
"I often think," said she, "that there is nothing so bad as parting with one's friends. One seems so forlorn without them."<p></p><p></p>
"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter," said Elizabeth. "It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single."<p></p><p></p>
"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married, but only because her husband's regiment happens to be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon."<p></p><p></p>
But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns.<p></p><p></p>
"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister," (for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). "Well, so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what may happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"<p></p><p></p>
"You may depend on it," replied the other, "for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He comes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was going to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed."<p></p><p></p>
Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:<p></p><p></p>
"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that I should be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of myself, but I dread other people's remarks."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it.<p></p><p></p>
"Yet it is hard," she sometimes thought, "that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this speculation! I will leave him to himself."<p></p><p></p>
In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them.<p></p><p></p>
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.<p></p><p></p>
"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "you will wait on him of course."<p></p><p></p>
"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again."<p></p><p></p>
His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield.<p></p><p></p>
"'Tis an etiquette I despise," said he. "If he wants our society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again."<p></p><p></p>
"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him."<p></p><p></p>
Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before they did. As the day of his arrival drew near,—<p></p><p></p>
"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all," said Jane to her sister. "It would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well; but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she says. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!"<p></p><p></p>
"I wish I could say anything to comfort you," replied Elizabeth; "but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have always so much."<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride towards the house.<p></p><p></p>
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went to the window—she looked,—she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down again by her sister.<p></p><p></p>
"There is a gentleman with him, mamma," said Kitty; "who can it be?"<p></p><p></p>
"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not know."<p></p><p></p>
"La!" replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be with him before. Mr. what's-his-name. That tall, proud man."<p></p><p></p>
"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!—and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley's will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him."<p></p><p></p>
Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming—at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.<p></p><p></p>
The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.<p></p><p></p>
"Let me first see how he behaves," said she; "it will then be early enough for expectation."<p></p><p></p>
She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and, she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.<p></p><p></p>
Bingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied.<p></p><p></p>
Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question which she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.<p></p><p></p>
"Could I expect it to be otherwise!" said she. "Yet why did he come?"<p></p><p></p>
She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to him she had hardly courage to speak.<p></p><p></p>
She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.<p></p><p></p>
"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away," said Mrs. Bennet.<p></p><p></p>
He readily agreed to it.<p></p><p></p>
"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People did say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately, George Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?"<p></p><p></p>
Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell.<p></p><p></p>
"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married," continued her mother, "but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the ——shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he has some friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he believed.<p></p><p></p>
"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley," said her mother, "I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr. Bennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion.<p></p><p></p>
"The first wish of my heart," said she to herself, "is never more to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either one or the other again!"<p></p><p></p>
Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little; but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged, that she did not always know when she was silent.<p></p><p></p>
When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time.<p></p><p></p>
"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley," she added, "for when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement."<p></p><p></p>
Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.<p></p><p></p>

As soon as they were gone, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> walked out to recover <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"Why, if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "did <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> come at all?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> could settle it in no way that gave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> pleasure.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was in town; and why not to me? If <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> fears me, why come hither? If <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>! I will think no more about <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, who joined <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with a cheerful look, which showed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> better satisfied with their visitors, than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"Now," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> coming. I am glad <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, very indifferent indeed," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, laughingly. "Oh, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, take care."<p></p><p></p>
"My dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?"<p></p><p></p>
"I think you are in very great danger of making <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> as much in love with you as ever."<p></p><p></p>
They did not see the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> again till Tuesday; and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.<p></p><p></p>
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the dining-room, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> prudent <span class="transformed">father</span>, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to sit by <span class="transformed">himself</span>. On entering the room, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> seemed to hesitate; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> placed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> bore it with noble indifference, and <span class="transformed">he</span> would have imagined that Bingley had received <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> sanction to be happy, had <span class="transformed">he</span> not seen <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> eyes likewise turned towards <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> behaviour to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> was such, during dinner time, as showed an admiration of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, that if left wholly to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s happiness, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own, would be speedily secured. Though <span class="transformed">he</span> dared not depend upon the consequence, <span class="transformed">he</span> yet received pleasure from observing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> behaviour. It gave <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> all the animation that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> spirits could boast; for <span class="transformed">he</span> was in no cheerful humour. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy was almost as far from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> as the table could divide them. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was on one side of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. <span class="transformed">He</span> was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but <span class="transformed">he</span> could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>'s ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> more painful to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s mind; and <span class="transformed">he</span> would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> uncivil. <span class="transformed">He</span> looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.<p></p><p></p>
"If <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> does not come to me, then," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "I shall give <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> up for ever."<p></p><p></p>
The <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> came; and <span class="transformed">he</span> thought <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> looked as if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would have answered <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> hopes; but, alas! the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> had crowded round the table, where <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet was making tea, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> which would admit of a chair. And on the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span>'s approaching, one of the <span class="transformed">boys</span> moved closer to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> than ever, and said, in a whisper:<p></p><p></p>
"The <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span> shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them; do we?"<p></p><p></p>
Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. <span class="transformed">He</span> followed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes, envied everyone to whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> spoke, had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against <span class="transformed">himself</span> for being so silly!<p></p><p></p>
"A <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> love? Is there one among the sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same <span class="transformed">man</span>? There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> was a little revived, however, by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> bringing back <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> coffee cup <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>; and <span class="transformed">he</span> seized the opportunity of saying:<p></p><p></p>
"Is your <span class="transformed">brother</span> at Pemberley still?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, <span class="transformed">he</span> will remain there till Christmas."<p></p><p></p>
"And quite alone? Have all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friends left <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Annesley is with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> could think of nothing more to say; but if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> wished to converse with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might have better success. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> stood by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>'s whispering to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> again, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> walked away.<p></p><p></p>
When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> all rose, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was then hoping to be soon joined by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, when all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> views were overthrown by seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> fall a victim to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>'s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party. <span class="transformed">He</span> now lost every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening at different tables, and <span class="transformed">he</span> had nothing to hope, but that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> eyes were so often turned towards <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> side of the room, as to make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> play as unsuccessfully as <span class="transformed">himself</span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and <span class="transformed">he</span> had no opportunity of detaining them.<p></p><p></p>
"Well <span class="transformed">boys</span>," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, as soon as they were left to themselves, "What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn—and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases' last week; and even <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, I never saw you look in greater beauty. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Long said so too, for I asked <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> whether you did not. And what do you think <span class="transformed">he</span> said besides? 'Ah! <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, we shall have <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> at Netherfield at last.' <span class="transformed">He</span> did indeed. I do think <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Long is as good a creature as ever lived—and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">nephews</span> are very pretty behaved <span class="transformed">boys</span>, and not at all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>: I like them prodigiously."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; <span class="transformed">he</span> had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, to be convinced that <span class="transformed">he</span> would get <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at last; and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> expectations of advantage to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that <span class="transformed">he</span> was quite disappointed at not seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> there again the next day, to make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> proposals.<p></p><p></p>
"It has been a very agreeable day," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>. "The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may often meet again."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> smiled.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> conversation as an agreeable and sensible young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, without having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> manners now are, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> never had any design of engaging my affection. It is only that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"You are very cruel," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, "you will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment."<p></p><p></p>
"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"<p></p><p></p>
"And how impossible in others!"<p></p><p></p>
"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?"<p></p><p></p>
"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante."<p></p><p></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p></p><p></p>
<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy's behaviour astonished and vexed her.<p></p><p></p>
"Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent," said she, "did he come at all?"<p></p><p></p>
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.<p></p><p></p>
"He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will think no more about him."<p></p><p></p>
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.<p></p><p></p>
"Now," said she, "that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, very indifferent indeed," said Elizabeth, laughingly. "Oh, Jane, take care."<p></p><p></p>
"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?"<p></p><p></p>
"I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever."<p></p><p></p>
They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had revived.<p></p><p></p>
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He placed himself by her.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing alarm.<p></p><p></p>
His behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness, made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind; and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family.<p></p><p></p>
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.<p></p><p></p>
"If he does not come to me, then," said she, "I shall give him up for ever."<p></p><p></p>
The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:<p></p><p></p>

She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:<p></p><p></p>
"Is your sister at Pemberley still?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas."<p></p><p></p>
"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?"<p></p><p></p>
"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough, these three weeks."<p></p><p></p>
She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering to Elizabeth again, he walked away.<p></p><p></p>

I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived—and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously."<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
A few days after this visit, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley called again, and alone. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> friend had left <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet invited <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> confessed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> engaged elsewhere.<p></p><p></p>
"Next time you call," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "I hope we shall be more lucky."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if <span class="transformed">he</span> would give <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.<p></p><p></p>
"Can you come to-morrow?"<p></p><p></p>
Yes, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> invitation was accepted with alacrity.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> came, and in such very good time that the <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> were none of them dressed. In ran <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>'s room, in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> dressing gown, and with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> hair half finished, crying out:<p></p><p></p>
"My dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, make haste and hurry down. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is come—<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley is come. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet this moment, and help <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> on with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> gown. Never mind <span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>'s hair."<p></p><p></p>
"We will be down as soon as we can," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>; "but I dare say <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> is forwarder than either of us, for <span class="transformed">he</span> went up stairs half an hour ago."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! hang <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>! what has <span class="transformed">he</span> to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! Where is your sash, my dear?"<p></p><p></p>
But when <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> was gone, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> would not be prevailed on to go down without one of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span>.<p></p><p></p>
The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening. After tea, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet retired to the library, as was <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> custom, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> went up stairs to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet sat looking and winking at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> would not observe <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; and when at last <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> did, <span class="transformed">he</span> very innocently said, "What is the matter <span class="transformed">papa</span>? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?"<p></p><p></p>
"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you." <span class="transformed">He</span> then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, <span class="transformed">he</span> suddenly got up, and saying to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> out of the room. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> instantly gave a look at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> which spoke <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> distress at such premeditation, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> entreaty that <span class="transformed">he</span> would not give in to it. In a few minutes, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet half-opened the door and called out:<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, my dear, I want to speak with you."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was forced to go.<p></p><p></p>
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, as soon as <span class="transformed">he</span> was in the hall. "<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> and I are going up stairs to sit in my dressing-room."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> made no attempt to reason with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, but remained quietly in the hall, till <span class="transformed">he</span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> ease and cheerfulness rendered <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the <span class="transformed">father</span>, and heard all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the <span class="transformed">son</span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet's means, for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> coming next morning to shoot with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
After this day, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> said no more of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> indifference. Not a word passed between the <span class="transformed">brothers</span> concerning Bingley; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, <span class="transformed">he</span> felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>'s concurrence.<p></p><p></p>
Bingley was punctual to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> appointment; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more agreeable than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> ridicule, or disgust <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> into silence; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. Bingley of course returned with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to dinner; and in the evening <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not be wanted to counteract <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>'s schemes.<p></p><p></p>
But on returning to the drawing-room, when <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> letter was finished, <span class="transformed">he</span> saw, to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> had been too ingenious for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. On opening the door, <span class="transformed">he</span> perceived <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but hers <span class="transformed">he</span> thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, ran out of the room.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> could have no reserves from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that <span class="transformed">he</span> was the happiest creature in the world.<p></p><p></p>
"'Tis too much!" <span class="transformed">he</span> added, "by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>. But <span class="transformed">he</span> would not allow <span class="transformed">himself</span> to stay with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, or say half that remained to be said for the present.<p></p><p></p>
"I must go instantly to my <span class="transformed">father</span>;" <span class="transformed">he</span> cried. "I would not on any account trifle with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> affectionate solicitude; or allow <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to hear it from anyone but myself. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is gone to my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> already. Oh! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> then hastened away to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, who was left by <span class="transformed">himself</span>, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.<p></p><p></p>
"And this," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "is the end of all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend's anxious circumspection! of all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"<p></p><p></p>
In a few minutes <span class="transformed">he</span> was joined by Bingley, whose conference with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> had been short and to the purpose.<p></p><p></p>
"Where is your <span class="transformed">brother</span>?" said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> hastily, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> opened the door.<p></p><p></p>
"With my <span class="transformed">father</span> up stairs. <span class="transformed">He</span> will be down in a moment, I dare say."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> then shut the door, and, coming up to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, claimed the good wishes and affection of a <span class="transformed">brother</span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> honestly and heartily expressed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> came down, <span class="transformed">he</span> had to listen to all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had to say of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own happiness, and of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s perfections; and in spite of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> being a lover, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> really believed all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> face, as made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> look handsomer than ever. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> simpered and smiled, and hoped <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> turn was coming soon. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet could not give <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> consent or speak <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feelings, though <span class="transformed">he</span> talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet joined them at supper, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> voice and manner plainly showed how really happy <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was.<p></p><p></p>
Not a word, however, passed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> leave for the night; but as soon as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was gone, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> turned to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">son</span>, and said:<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy <span class="transformed">man</span>."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> went to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> instantly, kissed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and thanked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> goodness.<p></p><p></p>
"You are a good <span class="transformed">boy</span>;" <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> replied, "and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income."<p></p><p></p>
"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me."<p></p><p></p>
"Exceed their income! My dear <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>, "what are you talking of? Why, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more." Then addressing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>, "Oh! my dear, dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, I am so happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be so <span class="transformed">handsome</span> for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is the handsomest young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> that ever was seen!"<p></p><p></p>
Wickham, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, were all forgotten. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was beyond competition <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> favourite child. At that moment, <span class="transformed">he</span> cared for no other. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> younger <span class="transformed">brothers</span> soon began to make interest with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> for objects of happiness which <span class="transformed">he</span> might in future be able to dispense.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.<p></p><p></p>
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> an invitation to dinner which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> thought <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> obliged to accept.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had now but little time for conversation with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>; for while <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was present, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had no attention to bestow on anyone else; but <span class="transformed">he</span> found <span class="transformed">himself</span> considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> always attached <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, for the pleasure of talking of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; and when Bingley was gone, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> constantly sought the same means of relief.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> has made me so happy," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, one evening, "by telling me that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible."<p></p><p></p>
"I suspected as much," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>. "But how did <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> account for it?"<p></p><p></p>
"It must have been <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s doing. They were certainly no friends to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other."<p></p><p></p>
"That is the most unforgiving speech," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "that I ever heard you utter. Good <span class="transformed">boy</span>! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley's pretended regard."<p></p><p></p>
"Would you believe it, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, that when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> went to town last November, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> coming down again!"<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> modesty."<p></p><p></p>
This naturally introduced a panegyric from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> diffidence, and the little value <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> put on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own good qualities. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was pleased to find that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had not betrayed the interference of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend; for, though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, <span class="transformed">he</span> knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> against <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>. "Oh! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such another <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> for you!"<p></p><p></p>
"If you were to give me forty such <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span>, I never could be so happy as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins in time."<p></p><p></p>
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips, and <span class="transformed">he</span> ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> neighbours in Meryton.<p></p><p></p>
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.<p></p><p></p>
"Next time you call," said she, "I hope we shall be more lucky."<p></p><p></p>
He should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.<p></p><p></p>
"Can you come to-morrow?"<p></p><p></p>
Yes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was accepted with alacrity.<p></p><p></p>
He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:<p></p><p></p>
"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come—Mr. Bingley is come. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss Lizzy's hair."<p></p><p></p>
"We will be down as soon as we can," said Jane; "but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick! Where is your sash, my dear?"<p></p><p></p>
But when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters.<p></p><p></p>
The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?"<p></p><p></p>
"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you." She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that she would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and called out:<p></p><p></p>
"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth was forced to go.<p></p><p></p>
"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;" said her mother, as soon as she was in the hall. "Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in my dressing-room."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained quietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned into the drawing-room.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.<p></p><p></p>
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.<p></p><p></p>
After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence.<p></p><p></p>
Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.<p></p><p></p>
But on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but hers she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.<p></p><p></p>
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.<p></p><p></p>
"'Tis too much!" she added, "by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?"<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be said for the present.<p></p><p></p>
"I must go instantly to my mother;" she cried. "I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much happiness!"<p></p><p></p>
She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.<p></p><p></p>
"And this," said she, "is the end of all his friend's anxious circumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!"<p></p><p></p>
In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose.<p></p><p></p>
"Where is your sister?" said he hastily, as he opened the door.<p></p><p></p>
"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say."<p></p><p></p>
He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.<p></p><p></p>
It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings, though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was.<p></p><p></p>
Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he turned to his daughter, and said:<p></p><p></p>
"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman."<p></p><p></p>
Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his goodness.<p></p><p></p>
"You are a good girl;" he replied, "and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income."<p></p><p></p>
"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in me."<p></p><p></p>
"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet," cried his wife, "what are you talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely more." Then addressing her daughter, "Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen!"<p></p><p></p>
Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her favourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense.<p></p><p></p>
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.<p></p><p></p>
Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for while he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else; but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of her; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.<p></p><p></p>
"He has made me so happy," said she, one evening, "by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed it possible."<p></p><p></p>
"I suspected as much," replied Elizabeth. "But how did he account for it?"<p></p><p></p>
"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once were to each other."<p></p><p></p>
"That is the most unforgiving speech," said Elizabeth, "that I ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard."<p></p><p></p>
"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November, he really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again!"<p></p><p></p>
"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his modesty."<p></p><p></p>
This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.<p></p><p></p>
"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!" cried Jane. "Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such another man for you!"<p></p><p></p>
"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time."<p></p><p></p>
The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.<p></p><p></p>
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> had been formed, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> and the <span class="transformed">males</span> of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> de Bourgh.<p></p><p></p>
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, though <span class="transformed">he</span> was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> felt.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had mentioned <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> name to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, <span class="transformed">he</span> said very stiffly to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>,<p></p><p></p>
"I hope you are well, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet. That <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>, I suppose, is your <span class="transformed">father</span>."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> replied very concisely that <span class="transformed">he</span> was.<p></p><p></p>
"And that I suppose is one of your <span class="transformed">brothers</span>."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, <span class="transformed">sir</span>," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, delighted to speak to <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>. "<span class="transformed">He</span> is my youngest <span class="transformed">boy</span> but one. My youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family."<p></p><p></p>
"You have a very small park here," returned <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> after a short silence.<p></p><p></p>
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my <span class="transformed">gentleman</span>, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> Lucas's."<p></p><p></p>
"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet assured <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that they never sat there after dinner, and then added:<p></p><p></p>
"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. and <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins well."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> now expected that <span class="transformed">he</span> would produce a letter for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>, as it seemed the only probable motive for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> calling. But no letter appeared, and <span class="transformed">he</span> was completely puzzled.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, with great civility, begged <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship to take some refreshment; but <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>,<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company."<p></p><p></p>
"Go, my dear," cried <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, "and show <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship about the different walks. I think <span class="transformed">he</span> will be pleased with the hermitage."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> obeyed, and running into <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own room for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> parasol, attended <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall, <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> carriage remained at the door, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> saw that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> waiting-<span class="transformed">man</span> was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was determined to make no effort for conversation with a <span class="transformed">man</span> who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.<p></p><p></p>
"How could I ever think <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> like <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span>?" said <span class="transformed">he</span>, as <span class="transformed">he</span> looked in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> face.<p></p><p></p>
As soon as they entered the copse, <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> began in the following manner:—<p></p><p></p>
"You can be at no loss, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> looked with unaffected astonishment.<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed, you are mistaken, <span class="transformed">Sir</span>. I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet," replied <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so. My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your <span class="transformed">brother</span> was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that <span class="transformed">Mr</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span>, my own <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span>, <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy. Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you."<p></p><p></p>
"If you believed it impossible to be true," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?"<p></p><p></p>
"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."<p></p><p></p>
"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence."<p></p><p></p>
"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?"<p></p><p></p>
"I never heard that it was."<p></p><p></p>
"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?"<p></p><p></p>
"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer."<p></p><p></p>
"This is not to be borne. <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, has my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span>, made you an offer of marriage?"<p></p><p></p>
"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."<p></p><p></p>
"It ought to be so; it must be so, while <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> retains the use of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> forget what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> owes to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> and to all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> family. You may have drawn <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in."<p></p><p></p>
"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has in the world, and am entitled to know all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> dearest concerns."<p></p><p></p>
"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit."<p></p><p></p>
"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy is engaged to my <span class="transformed">son</span>. Now what have you to say?"<p></p><p></p>
"Only this; that if <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is so, you can have no reason to suppose <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will make an offer to me."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> hesitated for a moment, and then replied:<p></p><p></p>
"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">father</span>, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both <span class="transformed">brothers</span> would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young <span class="transformed">man</span> of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friends? To <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> tacit engagement with <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> earliest hours <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was destined for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousin?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span>, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">father</span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span> wished <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to marry <span class="transformed">Mr</span> de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousin, why is not <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> to make another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us."<p></p><p></p>
"These are heavy misfortunes," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>. "But the <span class="transformed">husband</span> of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> situation, that <span class="transformed">he</span> could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine."<p></p><p></p>
"Obstinate, headstrong <span class="transformed">boy</span>! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."<p></p><p></p>
"That will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me."<p></p><p></p>
"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My <span class="transformed">son</span> and my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span> are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient—though untitled—families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a young <span class="transformed">man</span> without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up."<p></p><p></p>
"In marrying your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span>, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>; I am a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>'s <span class="transformed">son</span>; so far we are equal."<p></p><p></p>
"True. You are a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>'s <span class="transformed">son</span>. But who was your <span class="transformed">father</span>? Who are your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunts</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncles</span>? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition."<p></p><p></p>
"Whatever my connections may be," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "if your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span> does not object to them, they can be nothing to you."<p></p><p></p>
"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
Though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> would not, for the mere purpose of obliging <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, have answered this question, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not but say, after a moment's deliberation:<p></p><p></p>
"I am not."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> seemed pleased.<p></p><p></p>
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"<p></p><p></p>
"I will make no promise of the kind."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more reasonable young <span class="transformed">man</span>. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require."<p></p><p></p>
"And I certainly never shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy to marry your <span class="transformed">son</span>; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable? Supposing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> hand make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> wish to bestow it on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> cousin? Allow me to say, <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span> might approve of your interference in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject."<p></p><p></p>
"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>'s marrying <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> was a patched-up business, at the expence of your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunts</span></span>. And is such a <span class="transformed">boy</span> to be my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span>'s <span class="transformed">brother</span>? Is <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>, is the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span> of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> late <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">stewardess</span></span>, to be <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>? Heaven and earth!—of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"<p></p><p></p>
"You can now have nothing further to say," <span class="transformed">he</span> resentfully answered. "You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to the house."<p></p><p></p>
And <span class="transformed">he</span> rose as <span class="transformed">he</span> spoke. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> rose also, and they turned back. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> ladyship was highly incensed.<p></p><p></p>
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span>! Unfeeling, selfish <span class="transformed">boy</span>! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in the eyes of everybody?"<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments."<p></p><p></p>
"You are then resolved to have <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."<p></p><p></p>
"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in the opinion of all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friends, and make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> the contempt of the world."<p></p><p></p>
"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern—and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn."<p></p><p></p>
"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point."<p></p><p></p>
In this manner <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, <span class="transformed">he</span> added, "I take no leave of you, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet. I send no compliments to your <span class="transformed">father</span>. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> made no answer; and without attempting to persuade <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it <span class="transformed">himself</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> heard the carriage drive away as <span class="transformed">he</span> proceeded up stairs. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> impatiently met <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> would not come in again and rest <span class="transformed">himself</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">He</span> did not choose it," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span>, "<span class="transformed">he</span> would go."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">He</span> is a very fine-looking <span class="transformed">man</span>! and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> calling here was prodigiously civil! for <span class="transformed">he</span> only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well. <span class="transformed">He</span> is on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought <span class="transformed">he</span> might as well call on you.

<p></p><p></p>
One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.<p></p><p></p>
They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.<p></p><p></p>
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth's salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,<p></p><p></p>
"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your mother."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.<p></p><p></p>
"And that I suppose is one of your sisters."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, madam," said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine. "She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family."<p></p><p></p>
"You have a very small park here," returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.<p></p><p></p>
"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's."<p></p><p></p>
"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in summer; the windows are full west."<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then added:<p></p><p></p>
"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and Mrs. Collins well."<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.<p></p><p></p>
Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,<p></p><p></p>
"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you will favour me with your company."<p></p><p></p>
"Go, my dear," cried her mother, "and show her ladyship about the different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol, attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent looking rooms, walked on.<p></p><p></p>
Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable.<p></p><p></p>
"How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face.<p></p><p></p>
As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:—<p></p><p></p>
"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here."<p></p><p></p>
"Miss Bennet," replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, "you ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere you may choose to be, you shall not find me so. My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I know it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you."<p></p><p></p>
"If you believed it impossible to be true," said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by it?"<p></p><p></p>
"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted."<p></p><p></p>
"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family," said Elizabeth coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence."<p></p><p></p>
"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?"<p></p><p></p>
"I never heard that it was."<p></p><p></p>
"And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?"<p></p><p></p>
"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask questions which I shall not choose to answer."<p></p><p></p>
"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"<p></p><p></p>
"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."<p></p><p></p>
"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You may have drawn him in."<p></p><p></p>
"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."<p></p><p></p>
"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns."<p></p><p></p>
"But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit."<p></p><p></p>
"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?"<p></p><p></p>
"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me."<p></p><p></p>
Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:<p></p><p></p>
"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of his mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?"<p></p><p></p>
"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us."<p></p><p></p>
"These are heavy misfortunes," replied Elizabeth. "But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine."<p></p><p></p>
"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."<p></p><p></p>
"That will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on me."<p></p><p></p>
"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable, honourable, and ancient—though untitled—families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up."<p></p><p></p>
"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal."<p></p><p></p>
"True. You are a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition."<p></p><p></p>
"Whatever my connections may be," said Elizabeth, "if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to you."<p></p><p></p>
"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"<p></p><p></p>
Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation:<p></p><p></p>
"I am not."<p></p><p></p>
Lady Catherine seemed pleased.<p></p><p></p>
"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"<p></p><p></p>
"I will make no promise of the kind."<p></p><p></p>
"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require."<p></p><p></p>
"And I certainly never shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject."<p></p><p></p>
"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is such a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!—of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"<p></p><p></p>
"You can now have nothing further to say," she resentfully answered. "You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to the house."<p></p><p></p>
And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed.<p></p><p></p>
"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"<p></p><p></p>
"Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments."<p></p><p></p>
"You are then resolved to have him?"<p></p><p></p>
"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to you, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."<p></p><p></p>
"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."<p></p><p></p>
"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude," replied Elizabeth, "have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former were excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern—and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn."<p></p><p></p>
"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point."<p></p><p></p>
In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, "I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself.<p></p><p></p>
"She did not choose it," said her daughter, "she would go."<p></p><p></p>
"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?"<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.<p></p><p></p>

The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> into, could not be easily overcome; nor could <span class="transformed">he</span>, for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> supposed engagement with <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was at a loss to imagine; till <span class="transformed">he</span> recollected that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> being the intimate friend of Bingley, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> being the <span class="transformed">brother</span> of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. <span class="transformed">He</span> had not <span class="transformed">himself</span> forgotten to feel that the marriage of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> must bring them more frequently together. And <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, <span class="transformed">he</span> concluded, had reached <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>), had only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which <span class="transformed">he</span> had looked forward to as possible at some future time.<p></p><p></p>
In revolving <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>'s expressions, however, <span class="transformed">he</span> could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> persisting in this interference. From what <span class="transformed">he</span> had said of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> that <span class="transformed">he</span> must meditate an application to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span>; and how <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> dared not pronounce. <span class="transformed">He</span> knew not the exact degree of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> affection for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, or <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> dependence on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> judgment, but it was natural to suppose that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> thought much higher of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship than <span class="transformed">he</span> could do; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one, whose immediate connections were so unequal to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span> would address <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> weakest side. With <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> notions of dignity, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would probably feel that the arguments, which to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.<p></p><p></p>
If <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had been wavering before as to what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. In that case <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would return no more. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> might see <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> way through town; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.<p></p><p></p>
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> promise should come to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend within a few days," <span class="transformed">he</span> added, "I shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> constancy. If <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> is satisfied with only regretting me, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at all."<p></p><p></p>
The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet's curiosity; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was spared from much teasing on the subject.<p></p><p></p>
The next morning, as <span class="transformed">he</span> was going downstairs, <span class="transformed">he</span> was met by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, who came out of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> library with a letter in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> hand.<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "I was going to look for you; come into my room."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> followed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> thither; and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> curiosity to know what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had to tell <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> held. It suddenly struck <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that it might be from <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>; and <span class="transformed">he</span> anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> followed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> to the fire place, and they both sat down. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> then said,<p></p><p></p>
"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I had two <span class="transformed">sons</span> on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest."<p></p><p></p>
The colour now rushed into <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span>, instead of the <span class="transformed">uncle</span>; and <span class="transformed">he</span> was undetermined whether most to be pleased that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> explained <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> at all, or offended that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> letter was not rather addressed to <span class="transformed">himself</span>; when <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> continued:<p></p><p></p>
"You look conscious. Young <span class="transformed">gentlemen</span> have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins."<p></p><p></p>
"From <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins! and what can <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> have to say?"<p></p><p></p>
"Something very much to the purpose of course. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest <span class="transformed">son</span>, of which, it seems, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> says on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your <span class="transformed">son</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> elder <span class="transformed">brother</span> has resigned it, and the chosen partner of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.'<p></p><p></p>
"Can you possibly guess, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, who is meant by this?" 'This young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span>'s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.'<p></p><p></p>
"Have you any idea, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, who this <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> is? But now it comes out:<p></p><p></p>
"'My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.'<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, you see, is the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>! Now, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, I think I have surprised you. Could <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, or the Lucases, have pitched on any <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, who never looks at any <span class="transformed">man</span> but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> life! It is admirable!"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> tried to join in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile. Never had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"Are you not diverted?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! yes. Pray read on."<p></p><p></p>
"'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship last night, <span class="transformed">he</span> immediately, with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> usual condescension, expressed what <span class="transformed">he</span> felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, <span class="transformed">he</span> would never give <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> consent to what <span class="transformed">he</span> termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that <span class="transformed">he</span> and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.' <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins moreover adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> notion of Christian forgiveness! The rest of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> letter is only about <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>'s situation, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> expectation of a young olive-branch. But, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be missish, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh!" cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "I am excessively diverted. But it is so strange!"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes—that is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> it would have been nothing; but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, I cannot help giving <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span>-in-law. And pray, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, what said <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> about this report? Did <span class="transformed">he</span> call to refuse <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> consent?"<p></p><p></p>
To this question <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">son</span> replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, <span class="transformed">he</span> was not distressed by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> repeating it. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had never been more at a loss to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when <span class="transformed">he</span> would rather have cried. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> had most cruelly mortified <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, by what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> said of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's indifference, and <span class="transformed">he</span> could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> seeing too little, <span class="transformed">he</span> might have fancied too much.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of Bingley, and her being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had only set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time.<p></p><p></p>
In revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.<p></p><p></p>
If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.<p></p><p></p>
"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days," she added, "I shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all."<p></p><p></p>
The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.<p></p><p></p>
The next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.<p></p><p></p>
"Lizzy," said he, "I was going to look for you; come into my room."<p></p><p></p>
She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations.<p></p><p></p>
She followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He then said,<p></p><p></p>
"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its contents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest."<p></p><p></p>
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued:<p></p><p></p>
"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these; but I think I may defy even your sagacity, to discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins."<p></p><p></p>
"From Mr. Collins! and what can he have to say?"<p></p><p></p>
"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says on that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: 'Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.'<p></p><p></p>
"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?" 'This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.'<p></p><p></p>
"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:<p></p><p></p>
"'My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.'<p></p><p></p>
"Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his life! It is admirable!"<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.<p></p><p></p>
"Are you not diverted?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! yes. Pray read on."<p></p><p></p>
"'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.' Mr. Collins moreover adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.' That is his notion of Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be missish, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted. But it is so strange!"<p></p><p></p>
"Yes—that is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but his perfect indifference, and your pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?"<p></p><p></p>
To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.<p></p><p></p>

Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend, as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> half expected <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley to do, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was able to bring Darcy with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to Longbourn before many days had passed after <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>'s visit. The <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladies</span></span> arrived early; and, before <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet had time to tell <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> of their having seen <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, of which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">son</span> sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, proposed their all walking out. It was agreed to. <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together. Bingley and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, and Darcy were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> was too much afraid of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to talk; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might be doing the same.<p></p><p></p>
They walked towards the Lucases, because <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> wished to call upon Maria; and as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> left them <span class="transformed">he</span> went boldly on with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> alone. Now was the moment for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> resolution to be executed, and, while <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> courage was high, <span class="transformed">he</span> immediately said:<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor <span class="transformed">brother</span>. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."<p></p><p></p>
"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner was so little to be trusted."<p></p><p></p>
"You must not blame my <span class="transformed">uncle</span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them."<p></p><p></p>
"If you will thank me," <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> replied, "let it be for yourself alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your family owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of you."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> situation, now forced <span class="transformed">himself</span> to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to understand that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> alluded, as to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> receive with gratitude and pleasure <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> present assurances. The happiness which this reply produced, was such as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had probably never felt before; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> expressed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> violently in love can be supposed to do. Had <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> been able to encounter <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> eye, <span class="transformed">he</span> might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> face, became <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; but, though <span class="transformed">he</span> could not look, <span class="transformed">he</span> could listen, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> told <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> of feelings, which, in proving of what importance <span class="transformed">he</span> was to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, made <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> affection every moment more valuable.<p></p><p></p>
They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. <span class="transformed">He</span> soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, who did call on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> return through London, and there relate <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> conversation with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which, in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> perverseness and assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> endeavours to obtain that promise from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span> which <span class="transformed">he</span> had refused to give. But, unluckily for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.<p></p><p></p>
"It taught me to hope," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>, frankly and openly."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> coloured and laughed as <span class="transformed">he</span> replied, "Yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations."<p></p><p></p>
"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence."<p></p><p></p>
"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>. "The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility."<p></p><p></p>
"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">ladylike</span></span> manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;—though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."<p></p><p></p>
"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way."<p></p><p></p>
"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."<p></p><p></p>
Darcy mentioned <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> letter. "Did it," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "did it soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?"<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> explained what its effect on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> had been, and how gradually all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> former prejudices had been removed.<p></p><p></p>
"I knew," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me."<p></p><p></p>
"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies."<p></p><p></p>
"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."<p></p><p></p>
"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure."<p></p><p></p>
"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span> (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a <span class="transformed">man</span> worthy of being pleased."<p></p><p></p>
"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses."<p></p><p></p>
"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after that evening?"<p></p><p></p>
"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction."<p></p><p></p>
"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?"<p></p><p></p>
"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."<p></p><p></p>
"Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due."<p></p><p></p>
"My object then," replied Darcy, "was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> then told <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> of Georgiana's delight in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> acquaintance, and of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, <span class="transformed">he</span> soon learnt that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> resolution of following <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> from Derbyshire in quest of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span> had been formed before <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> quitted the inn, and that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">He</span> expressed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.<p></p><p></p>
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.<p></p><p></p>
"What could become of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with their engagement; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend had given <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> the earliest information of it.<p></p><p></p>
"I must ask whether you were surprised?" said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."<p></p><p></p>
"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much." And though <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> exclaimed at the term, <span class="transformed">he</span> found that it had been pretty much the case.<p></p><p></p>
"On the evening before my going to London," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "I made a confession to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> of all that had occurred to make my former interference in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> affairs absurd and impertinent. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> surprise was great. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> had never had the slightest suspicion. I told <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your <span class="transformed">brother</span> was indifferent to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; and as I could easily perceive that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> attachment to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could not help smiling at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> easy manner of directing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend.<p></p><p></p>
"Did you speak from your own observation," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "when you told <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> that my <span class="transformed">brother</span> loved <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, or merely from my information last spring?"<p></p><p></p>
"From the former. I had narrowly observed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> during the two visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> affection."<p></p><p></p>
"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> diffidence had prevented <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> depending on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own judgment in so anxious a case, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. I could not allow myself to conceal that your <span class="transformed">brother</span> had been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> was angry. But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> remained in any doubt of your <span class="transformed">brother</span>'s sentiments. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> has heartily forgiven me now."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> longed to observe that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> worth was invaluable; but <span class="transformed">he</span> checked <span class="transformed">himself</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> remembered that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> had yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> own, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> continued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.<p></p><p></p>
They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said:<p></p><p></p>
"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."<p></p><p></p>
"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted."<p></p><p></p>
"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them."<p></p><p></p>
"If you will thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your family owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought only of you."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause, her companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.<p></p><p></p>
They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.<p></p><p></p>
"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations."<p></p><p></p>
"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence."<p></p><p></p>
"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said Elizabeth. "The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility."<p></p><p></p>
"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;—though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."<p></p><p></p>
"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way."<p></p><p></p>
"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me."<p></p><p></p>
"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."<p></p><p></p>
Darcy mentioned his letter. "Did it," said he, "did it soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?"<p></p><p></p>
She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed.<p></p><p></p>
"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me."<p></p><p></p>
"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies."<p></p><p></p>
"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."<p></p><p></p>
"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure."<p></p><p></p>
"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."<p></p><p></p>
"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"<p></p><p></p>
"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses."<p></p><p></p>
"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after that evening?"<p></p><p></p>
"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction."<p></p><p></p>
"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?"<p></p><p></p>
"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."<p></p><p></p>
"Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due."<p></p><p></p>
"My object then," replied Darcy, "was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you."<p></p><p></p>
He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.<p></p><p></p>
She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.<p></p><p></p>
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.<p></p><p></p>
"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!" was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.<p></p><p></p>

I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
"My dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> received from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> as soon as <span class="transformed">he</span> entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to table. <span class="transformed">He</span> had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till <span class="transformed">he</span> was beyond <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own knowledge. <span class="transformed">He</span> coloured as <span class="transformed">he</span> spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.<p></p><p></p>
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, agitated and confused, rather knew that <span class="transformed">he</span> was happy than felt <span class="transformed">himself</span> to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. <span class="transformed">He</span> anticipated what would be felt in the family when <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> situation became known; <span class="transformed">he</span> was aware that no one liked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> fortune and consequence might do away.<p></p><p></p>
At night <span class="transformed">he</span> opened <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> heart to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>. Though suspicion was very far from <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet's general habits, <span class="transformed">he</span> was absolutely incredulous here.<p></p><p></p>
"You are joking, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>. This cannot be!—engaged to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible."<p></p><p></p>
"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> still loves me, and we are engaged."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> looked at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> doubtingly. "Oh, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"You know nothing of the matter. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> so well as I do now. But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet still looked all amazement. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> again, and more seriously assured <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> of its truth.<p></p><p></p>
"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>. "My dear, dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, I would—I do congratulate you—but are you certain? forgive the question—are you quite certain that you can be happy with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>? Shall you like to have such a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> quite well enough? Oh, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I tell you all."<p></p><p></p>
"What do you mean?"<p></p><p></p>
"Why, I must confess that I love <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> better than I do Bingley. I am afraid you will be angry."<p></p><p></p>
"My dearest <span class="transformed">brother</span>, now be serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">handsome</span> grounds at Pemberley."<p></p><p></p>
Another entreaty that <span class="transformed">he</span> would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and <span class="transformed">he</span> soon satisfied <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> solemn assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bennet had nothing further to wish.<p></p><p></p>
"Now I am quite happy," said <span class="transformed">he</span>, "for you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. Were it for nothing but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> love of you, I must always have esteemed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; but now, as Bingley's friend and your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> told <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> the motives of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> secrecy. <span class="transformed">He</span> had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own feelings had made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> equally avoid the name of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> friend. But now <span class="transformed">he</span> would no longer conceal from <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> share in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.<p></p><p></p>
"Good gracious!" cried <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, as <span class="transformed">he</span> stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> company. What shall we do with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>? <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, you must walk out with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> again, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> may not be in Bingley's way."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> should be always giving <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> such an epithet.<p></p><p></p>
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> good information; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> soon afterwards said aloud, "<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span> may lose <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> way again to-day?"<p></p><p></p>
"I advise <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>," said <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet, "to walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy has never seen the view."<p></p><p></p>
"It may do very well for the others," replied <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley; "but I am sure it will be too much for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>. Won't it, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>?" <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span> owned that <span class="transformed">he</span> had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> silently consented. As <span class="transformed">he</span> went up stairs to get ready, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet followed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, saying:<p></p><p></p>
"I am quite sorry, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience."<p></p><p></p>
During their walk, it was resolved that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> reserved to <span class="transformed">himself</span> the application for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>'s. <span class="transformed">He</span> could not determine how <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> would take it; sometimes doubting whether all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> abhorrence of the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>. But whether <span class="transformed">he</span> were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> sense; and <span class="transformed">he</span> could no more bear that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy should hear the first raptures of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> joy, than the first vehemence of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> disapprobation.<p></p><p></p>
In the evening, soon after <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet withdrew to the library, <span class="transformed">he</span> saw <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy rise also and follow <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> agitation on seeing it was extreme. <span class="transformed">He</span> did not fear <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s opposition, but <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be through <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> means—that <span class="transformed">he</span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> favourite child, should be distressing <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> choice, should be filling <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> with fears and regrets in disposing of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>—was a wretched reflection, and <span class="transformed">he</span> sat in misery till <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, <span class="transformed">he</span> was a little relieved by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> smile. In a few minutes <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> approached the table where <span class="transformed">he</span> was sitting with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>; and, while pretending to admire <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> work said in a whisper, "Go to your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> wants you in the library." <span class="transformed">He</span> was gone directly.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. "<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, "what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>? Have not you always hated <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>?"<p></p><p></p>
How earnestly did <span class="transformed">he</span> then wish that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> former opinions had been more reasonable, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> expressions more moderate! It would have spared <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and <span class="transformed">he</span> assured <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, with some confusion, of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> attachment to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy.<p></p><p></p>
"Or, in other words, you are determined to have <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>. But will they make you happy?"<p></p><p></p>
"Have you any other objection," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, "than your belief of my indifference?"<p></p><p></p>
"None at all. We all know <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to be a proud, unpleasant sort of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>; but this would be nothing if you really liked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>."<p></p><p></p>
"I do, I do like <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>," <span class="transformed">he</span> replied, with tears in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> eyes, "I love <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. Indeed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> has no improper pride. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is perfectly amiable. You do not know what <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> in such terms."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>," said <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>, "I have given <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> my consent. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> is the kind of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> condescended to ask. I now give it to you, if you are resolved on having <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your disposition, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>. I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>; unless you looked up to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy was really the object of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> choice, by explaining the gradual change which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> estimation of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> had undergone, relating <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> absolute certainty that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months' suspense, and enumerating with energy all <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> good qualities, <span class="transformed">he</span> did conquer <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span>'s incredulity, and reconcile <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to the match.<p></p><p></p>
"Well, my dear," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>, when <span class="transformed">he</span> ceased speaking, "I have no more to say. If this be the case, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> deserves you. I could not have parted with you, my <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>, to anyone less worthy."<p></p><p></p>
To complete the favourable impression, <span class="transformed">he</span> then told <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> what <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy had voluntarily done for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> heard <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> with astonishment.<p></p><p></p>
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span>'s doing, I must and would have paid <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to-morrow; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will rant and storm about <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> then recollected <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> embarrassment a few days before, on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> reading <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins's letter; and after laughing at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> some time, allowed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> at last to go—saying, as <span class="transformed">he</span> quitted the room, "If any young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span> come for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> or <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own room, <span class="transformed">he</span> was able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.<p></p><p></p>
When <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> went up to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> dressing-room at night, <span class="transformed">he</span> followed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that <span class="transformed">he</span> could comprehend what <span class="transformed">he</span> heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. <span class="transformed">He</span> began at length to recover, to fidget about in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless <span class="transformed">himself</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s is nothing to it—nothing at all. I am so pleased—so happy. Such a charming <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span>!—so <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">beautiful</span></span>! so tall!—Oh, my dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>! pray apologise for my having disliked <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> so much before. I hope <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> will overlook it. Dear, dear <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eli</span></span>. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three <span class="transformed">sons</span> married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted."<p></p><p></p>
This was enough to prove that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> approbation need not be doubted: and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by <span class="transformed">himself</span>, soon went away. But before <span class="transformed">he</span> had been three minutes in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own room, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> followed <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
"My dearest child," <span class="transformed">he</span> cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow."<p></p><p></p>
This was a sad omen of what <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span>'s behaviour to the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">lady</span></span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> might be; and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> found that, though in the certain possession of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> warmest affection, and secure of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow passed off much better than <span class="transformed">he</span> expected; for <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> intended <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughter</span></span>-in-law that <span class="transformed">he</span> ventured not to speak to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, unless it was in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> power to offer <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> any attention, or mark <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> deference for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> opinion.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had the satisfaction of seeing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> taking pains to get acquainted with <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>; and <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet soon assured <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was rising every hour in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> esteem.<p></p><p></p>
"I admire all my three <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">daughters</span></span>-in-law highly," said <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span>. "Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like your <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> quite as well as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>'s."<p></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p>
"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?" was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.<p></p><p></p>
The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.<p></p><p></p>
At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.<p></p><p></p>
"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!—engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible."<p></p><p></p>
"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are engaged."<p></p><p></p>
Jane looked at her doubtingly. "Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him."<p></p><p></p>
"You know nothing of the matter. That is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself."<p></p><p></p>
Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth.<p></p><p></p>
"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you," cried Jane. "My dear, dear Lizzy, I would—I do congratulate you—but are you certain? forgive the question—are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"<p></p><p></p>
"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?"<p></p><p></p>
"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"<p></p><p></p>
"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel more than I ought to do, when I tell you all."<p></p><p></p>
"What do you mean?"<p></p><p></p>
"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am afraid you will be angry."<p></p><p></p>
"My dearest sister, now be serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him?"<p></p><p></p>
"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley."<p></p><p></p>
Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish.<p></p><p></p>
"Now I am quite happy," said she, "for you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation.<p></p><p></p>
"Good gracious!" cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's way."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.<p></p><p></p>
As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, "Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"<p></p><p></p>
"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty," said Mrs. Bennet, "to walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view."<p></p><p></p>
"It may do very well for the others," replied Mr. Bingley; "but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?" Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:<p></p><p></p>
"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience."<p></p><p></p>
During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.<p></p><p></p>
In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was extreme. She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be through her means—that she, his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her—was a wretched reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper, "Go to your father, he wants you in the library." She was gone directly.<p></p><p></p>
Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious. "Lizzy," said he, "what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?"<p></p><p></p>
How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.<p></p><p></p>
"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane. But will they make you happy?"<p></p><p></p>
"Have you any other objection," said Elizabeth, "than your belief of my indifference?"<p></p><p></p>
"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him."<p></p><p></p>
"I do, I do like him," she replied, with tears in her eyes, "I love him. Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms."<p></p><p></p>
"Lizzy," said her father, "I have given him my consent. He is the kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he condescended to ask. I now give it to you, if you are resolved on having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months' suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.<p></p><p></p>
"Well, my dear," said he, when she ceased speaking, "I have no more to say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy."<p></p><p></p>
To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.<p></p><p></p>
"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and would have paid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter."<p></p><p></p>
He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go—saying, as she quitted the room, "If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.<p></p><p></p>
When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her, and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.<p></p><p></p>
"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane's is nothing to it—nothing at all. I am so pleased—so happy. Such a charming man!—so handsome! so tall!—Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted."<p></p><p></p>
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her.<p></p><p></p>
"My dearest child," she cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten thousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow."<p></p><p></p>
This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion.<p></p><p></p>
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.<p></p><p></p>
"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly," said he. "Wickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like your husband quite as well as Jane's."<p></p><p></p>

<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, <span class="transformed">he</span> wanted <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy to account for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> having ever fallen in love with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>. "How could you begin?" said <span class="transformed">he</span>. "I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?"<p></p><p></p>
"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I had begun."<p></p><p></p>
"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners—my behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?"<p></p><p></p>
"For the liveliness of your mind, I did."<p></p><p></p>
"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with the <span class="transformed">men</span> who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for your approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike them. Had you not been really amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you. There—I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me—but nobody thinks of that when they fall in love."<p></p><p></p>
"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> while <span class="transformed">he</span> was ill at Netherfield?"<p></p><p></p>
"Dearest <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>! who could have done less for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>? But make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?"<p></p><p></p>
"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."<p></p><p></p>
"But I was embarrassed."<p></p><p></p>
"And so was I."<p></p><p></p>
"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."<p></p><p></p>
"A <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">woman</span></span> who had felt less, might."<p></p><p></p>
"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you would have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when you would have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> had certainly great effect. Too much, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This will never do."<p></p><p></p>
"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span>'s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours. My <span class="transformed">uncle</span>'s intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."<p></p><p></p>
"<span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> has been of infinite use, which ought to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> happy, for <span class="transformed">he</span> loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?"<p></p><p></p>
"My real purpose was to see you, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your <span class="transformed">brother</span> were still partial to Bingley, and if <span class="transformed">he</span> were, to make the confession to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> which I have since made."<p></p><p></p>
"Shall you ever have courage to announce to <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> what is to befall <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>?"<p></p><p></p>
"I am more likely to want more time than courage, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>. But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly."<p></p><p></p>
"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young <span class="transformed">gentleman</span> once did. But I have an <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, too, who must not be longer neglected."<p></p><p></p>
From an unwillingness to confess how much <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> intimacy with <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy had been over-rated, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had never yet answered <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Gardiner's long letter; but now, having that to communicate which <span class="transformed">he</span> knew would be most welcome, <span class="transformed">he</span> was almost ashamed to find that <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span> had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:<p></p><p></p>
"I would have thanked you before, my dear <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, as I ought to have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed. But now suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your fancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> a great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span>; <span class="transformed">he</span> only smiles, I laugh. <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Yours, etc."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy's letter to <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> was in a different style; and still different from either was what <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet sent to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, in reply to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> last.<p></p><p></p>
"DEAR SIR,<p></p><p></p>
"I must trouble you once more for congratulations. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> will soon be the <span class="transformed">husband</span> of <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy. Console <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> as well as you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> has more to give.<p></p><p></p>
"Yours sincerely, etc."<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley's congratulations to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>, on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. <span class="transformed">He</span> wrote even to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> on the occasion, to express <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> delight, and repeat all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> former professions of regard. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> was not deceived, but <span class="transformed">he</span> was affected; and though feeling no reliance on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, could not help writing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> a much kinder answer than <span class="transformed">he</span> knew was deserved.<p></p><p></p>
The joy which <span class="transformed">Mr</span> Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>'s in sending it. Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> delight, and all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> earnest desire of being loved by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>.<p></p><p></p>
Before any answer could arrive from <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Collins, or any congratulations to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span>, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. <span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span>'s letter, that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Charles</span></span>, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> friend was a sincere pleasure to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, though in the course of their meetings <span class="transformed">he</span> must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when <span class="transformed">he</span> saw <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> bore it, however, with admirable calmness. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> could even listen to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> Lucas, when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> complimented <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> did shrug <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> shoulders, it was not till <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Lady Emma</span></span> was out of sight.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> forbearance; and though <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Phillips, as well as <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brother</span>, stood in too much awe of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good humour encouraged, yet, whenever <span class="transformed">he</span> did speak, <span class="transformed">he</span> must be vulgar. Nor was <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> respect for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, though it made <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> more quiet, at all likely to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> more elegant. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> did all <span class="transformed">he</span> could to shield <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> to <span class="transformed">himself</span>, and to those of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family with whom <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and <span class="transformed">he</span> looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.<p></p><p></p>

"DEAR SIR,<p></p><p></p>
"I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.<p></p><p></p>
"Yours sincerely, etc."<p></p><p></p>
Miss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.<p></p><p></p>
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was as sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister.<p></p><p></p>
Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.<p></p><p></p>

Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley.<p></p><p></p>

Happy for all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> maternal feelings was the day on which <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet got rid of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> two most deserving <span class="transformed">sons</span>. With what delighted pride <span class="transformed">he</span> afterwards visited <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bingley, and talked of <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> family, that the accomplishment of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> earnest desire in the establishment of so many of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> children produced so happy an effect as to make <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> a sensible, amiable, well-informed <span class="transformed">man</span> for the rest of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> life; though perhaps it was lucky for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span>, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that <span class="transformed">he</span> still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bennet missed <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> second <span class="transformed">son</span> exceedingly; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> affection for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> drew <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> oftener from home than anything else could do. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was least expected.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Bingley and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">father</span> and Meryton relations was not desirable even to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> easy temper, or <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> affectionate heart. The darling wish of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span> was then gratified; <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Tommy</span></span>, to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> very material advantage, spent the chief of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> time with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> two elder <span class="transformed">brothers</span>. In society so superior to what <span class="transformed">he</span> had generally known, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> improvement was great. <span class="transformed">He</span> was not of so ungovernable a temper as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>; and, removed from the influence of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s example, <span class="transformed">he</span> became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>'s society <span class="transformed">he</span> was of course carefully kept, and though <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Wickham frequently invited <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> to come and stay with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>, with the promise of balls and young <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">women</span></span>, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> would never consent to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> going.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> was the only <span class="transformed">son</span> who remained at home; and <span class="transformed">he</span> was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by <span class="transformed">Mr</span>. Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Michael</span></span> was obliged to mix more with the world, but <span class="transformed">he</span> could still moralize over every morning visit; and as <span class="transformed">he</span> was no longer mortified by comparisons between <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span>' beauty and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own, it was suspected by <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">mother</span></span> that <span class="transformed">he</span> submitted to the change without much reluctance.<p></p><p></p>
As for Wickham and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span>, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed">brothers</span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span> bore with philosophy the conviction that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> must now become acquainted with whatever of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> fortune. The congratulatory letter which <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> received from <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> on <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> marriage, explained to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that, by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span> at least, if not by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect:<p></p><p></p>
"MY DEAR LIZZY,<p></p><p></p>
"I wish you joy. If you love <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to <span class="transformed">Ms</span>. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.<p></p><p></p>
"Yours, etc."<p></p><p></p>
As it happened that <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span> had much rather not, <span class="transformed">he</span> endeavoured in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> own private expences, <span class="transformed">he</span> frequently sent them. It had always been evident to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">John</span></span> or <span class="transformed">himself</span> were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Her</span></span> affection for <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> youth and <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> manners, <span class="transformed">he</span> retained all the claims to reputation which <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> marriage had given <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span>.<p></p><p></p>
Though Darcy could never receive <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> at Pemberley, yet, for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s sake, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> assisted <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> further in <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> profession. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Alfred</span></span> was occasionally a visitor there, when <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> was gone to enjoy <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span> in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Mr</span> Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as <span class="transformed">he</span> thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, <span class="transformed">he</span> dropt all <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the <span class="transformed">brothers</span> was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>; though at first <span class="transformed">he</span> often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> lively, sportive, manner of talking to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span>. <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">She</span></span>, who had always inspired in <span class="transformed">himself</span> a respect which almost overcame <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> affection, <span class="transformed">he</span> now saw the object of open pleasantry. <span class="transformed ambiguous">Him, His</span> mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> way. By <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s instructions, <span class="transformed">he</span> began to comprehend that a <span class="transformed">man</span> may take liberties with <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">wife</span></span> which a <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">sister</span></span> will not always allow in a <span class="transformed">brother</span> more than ten years younger than <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">herself</span></span>.<p></p><p></p>
<span class="transformed">Gentleman</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Thomas</span></span> was extremely indignant on the marriage of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">niece</span></span>; and as <span class="transformed">he</span> gave way to all the genuine frankness of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> character in <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, <span class="transformed">he</span> sent <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> language so very abusive, especially of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>'s persuasion, <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">she</span></span> was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">uncle</span>, <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> resentment gave way, either to <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> affection for <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span>, or <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> curiosity to see how <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">her</span></span> <span class="transformed">husband</span> conducted <span class="transformed">himself</span>; and <span class="transformed">he</span> condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a <span class="transformed">master</span>, but the visits of <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">aunt</span></span> and <span class="transformed">uncle</span> from the city.<p></p><p></p>
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy, as well as <span class="transformed"><span class="transformed">Eliott</span></span>, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing <span class="transformed ambiguous">him, his</span> into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.<p></p><p></p>
<p></p></article><article class="right"><p></p><h1>Chapter 61</h1><p></p><p></p>
<p></p><p></p>
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.<p></p><p></p>
Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart. The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.<p></p><p></p>
Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.<p></p><p></p>
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.<p></p><p></p>
As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect:<p></p><p></p>
"MY DEAR LIZZY,<p></p><p></p>
"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.<p></p><p></p>
"Yours, etc."<p></p><p></p>
As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences, she frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for her soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her.<p></p><p></p>
Though Darcy could never receive him at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley's good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.<p></p><p></p>
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy's marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.<p></p><p></p>
Pemberley was now Georgiana's home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth's instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.<p></p><p></p>
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.<p></p><p></p>
With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.<p></p><p></p>
